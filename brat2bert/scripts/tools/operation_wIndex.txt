miRNA target prediction has definition Identify or predict microRNA sequences (miRNA) and precursors or microRNA targets / binding sites in a DNA sequence.
siRNA binding specificity prediction has definition Assess binding specificity of putative siRNA sequence(s), for example for a functional assay, typically with respect to designing specific siRNA sequences.
tRNA gene prediction has definition Identify or predict tRNA genes in genomic sequences (tRNA).
trans-regulatory element prediction has definition Identify or predict functional RNA sequences with a gene regulatory role (trans-regulatory elements) or targets.
