The Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) raw data are stored in FASTA and FASTQ text-based file formats. Common operations on FASTA/Q files include searching, filtering, sampling, deduplication and sorting, among others. We can find several tools in the literature for FASTA/Q file manipulation but none of them are well fitted for large files of tens of GB (likely TBs in the near future) since mostly they are based on sequential processing. The exception is seqkit that allows some routines to use a few threads but, in any case, the scalability is very limited. To deal with this issue, we introduce BigSeqKit, a parallel toolkit to manipulate FASTA/Q files at scale with speed and scalability at its core. BigSeqKit takes advantage of an HPC-Big Data framework (IgnisHPC) to parallelize and optimize the commands included in seqkit. In this way, in most cases it is from tens to hundreds of times faster than other state-of-the-art tools such as seqkit, samtools and pyfastx.

The removal of non-brain signal from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, known as skull-stripping, is an integral component of many neuroimage analysis streams. Despite their abundance, popular classical skull-stripping methods are usually tailored to images with specific acquisition properties, namely near-isotropic resolution and T1-weighted (T1w) MRI contrast, which are prevalent in research settings. As a result, existing tools tend to adapt poorly to other image types, such as stacks of thick slices acquired with fast spin-echo (FSE) MRI that are common in the clinic. While learning-based approaches for brain extraction have gained traction in recent years, these methods face a similar burden, as they are only effective for image types seen during the training procedure. To achieve robust skull-stripping across a landscape of imaging protocols, we introduce SynthStrip, a rapid, learning-based brain-extraction tool

D-SCRIPT is a deep learning method for predicting a physical interaction between two proteins given just their sequences. It generalizes well to new species and is robust to limitations in training data size. Its design reflects the intuition that for two proteins to physically interact, a subset of amino acids from each protein should be in con-tact with the other. The intermediate stages of D-SCRIPT directly implement this intuition, with the penultimate stage in D-SCRIPT being a rough estimate of the inter-protein contact map of the protein dimer.

The Viral Host Range database represents a unique resource for the community to rapidly find, document analyze and disseminate data related to the range of hosts that a virus can infect. Over the years, countless host range experiments have been performed in many laboratories. However, these data are not readily available to the community and are therefore underexploited.. The VHRdb is an online resource that centralizes experimental data related to the host range of viruses. While it originates from bacteriophages and bacteria interaction studies, its design is compatible with viruses infecting all living forms. Users can browse publicly available data to find which host is infected by a virus, and vice versa. Users can also upload their own data while keeping it private or making it public, analyze results across independent sets of data, generate and visualize outputs. Data implemented in the VHRdb are linked to users and, if available, to publications and sequence identifiers.

ARBic can accurately identify any meaningful biclusters of shape no matter broad or narrow in a large scale gene expression data matrix, even when the values in the biclusters to be identified have the same distribution as that the background data has. ARBic is developed by integrating column-based and row-based strategies into biclustering procedure. The column-based strategy borrowed from ReBic, a recently published biclustering tool, prefers to narrow bicluters.

EMIRGE (Expectation-Maximization Iterative Reconstruction of Genes from the Environment)  reconstructs full length ribosomal genes from short read sequencing data. In the process, it also provides estimates of the sequences' abundances. EMIRGE uses a modification of the EM algorithm to iterate between estimating the expected value of the abundance of all SSU sequences present in a sample and estimating the probabilities for each read that a specific sequence generated that read.  At the end of each iteration, those probabilities are used to re-calculate (correct) a consensus sequence for each reference SSU sequence, and the mapping is. repeated, followed by the estimations of probabilities. The iterations should usually stop when the reference sequences no longer change from one iteration to the next.  Practically, 40-80 iterations is usually sufficient for many samples. Right now EMIRGE uses Bowtie alignments internally, though in theory a different mapper could be used.

Our variation of canopy clustering focuses on efficient clustering of points in multi-dimensional pearson correlation space. The basic notion of the heuristic is choosing a point(seed point) at random, and upon establishing it's distance to all the other points, single out those that are within a specified canopy distance. A median profile of those points is then calculated creating a canopy centroid. The canopy creation process is then repeated perpetually(canopy walk) from the previously created centroid until the distance between previous centroid is small enough. All points from the last canopy are then marked, and will not become seed points again. The above will be repeated for all possible seed points.

The feature-rich datasets produced from such experiments require extensive and diverse computational analyses, each of which can significantly influence the downstream immunological interpretations, such as clonal selection and expansion. Simulations produce validated standard datasets, where the underlying generative model can be precisely defined and furthermore perturbed to investigate specific questions of interest. Currently, there is no tool that can be used to simulate a comprehensive ground truth single-cell dataset that incorporates both immune receptor repertoires and gene expression.

Indexing Trapped Ion Mobility Spectrometry-TOF Data for Fast and Easy Accession and Visualization.. High-resolution MS-based proteomics generates large amounts of data, even in the standard LC-tandem MS configuration. Adding an ion mobility dimension vastly increases the acquired data volume, challenging both analytical processing pipelines and especially data exploration by scientists. This has necessitated data aggregation, effectively discarding much of the information present in these rich datasets. Taking trapped ion mobility spectrometry (TIMS) on a quadrupole TOF (Q-TOF) platform as an example, we developed an efficient indexing scheme that represents all data points as detector arrival times on scales of minutes (LC), milliseconds (TIMS), and microseconds (TOF). In our open-source AlphaTims package, data are indexed, accessed, and visualized by a combination of tools of the scientific Python ecosystem
AddTag is a two-step approach with supporting software package that facilitates CRISPR/Cas-mediated precision genome editing.. CRISPR Cas-induced genome editing is a powerful tool for genetic engineering, however, targeting constraints limit which loci are editable with this method. Since the length of a DNA sequence impacts the likelihood it overlaps a unique target site, precision editing of small genomic features with CRISPR Cas remains an obstacle. We introduce a two-step genome editing strategy that virtually eliminates CRISPR Cas targeting constraints and facilitates precision genome editing of elements as short as a single base-pair at virtually any locus in any organism that supports CRISPR Cas-induced genome editing. Our two-step approach first replaces the locus of interest with an "AddTag" sequence, which is subsequently replaced with any engineered sequence, and thus circumvents the need for direct overlap with a unique CRISPR Cas target site.

Transcriptome wide association studies (TWAS) can be used as a powerful method to identify and interpret the underlying biological mechanisms behind GWAS by mapping gene expression levels with phenotypes. In TWAS, gene expression is often imputed from individual-level genotypes of regulatory variants identified from external resources, such as Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) Project. In this setting, a straightforward approach to impute expression levels of a specific tissue is to use the model trained from the same tissue type. When multiple tissues are available for the same subjects, it has been demonstrated that training imputation models from multiple tissue types improves the accuracy because of shared eQTLs between the tissues and increase in effective sample size.

Assessment of weighted topological overlap (wTO) to improve fidelity of gene co-expression networks.. For more than a decade, gene expression data sets have been used as basis for the construction of co-expression networks used in systems biology investigations, leading to many important discoveries in a wide range of subjects spanning human disease to evolution and the development of organisms. A commonly encountered challenge in such investigations is first that of detecting, then subsequently removing, spurious correlations (i.e. links) in these networks. While access to a large number of measurements per gene would reduce this problem, often only a small number of measurements are available. The weighted Topological Overlap (wTO) measure, which incorporates information from the shared network-neighborhood of a given gene-pair into a single score, is a metric that is frequently used with the implicit expectation of producing higher-quality networks

Privacy-Preserving Tensor Factorization for Collaborative Health Data Analysis.. Tensor factorization has been demonstrated as an efficient approach for computational phenotyping, where massive electronic health records (EHRs) are converted to concise and meaningful clinical concepts. While distributing the tensor factorization tasks to local sites can avoid direct data sharing, it still requires the exchange of intermediary results which could reveal sensitive patient information. Therefore, the challenge is how to jointly decompose the tensor under rigorous and principled privacy constraints, while still support the model's interpretability. We propose DPFact, a privacy-preserving collaborative tensor factorization method for computational phenotyping using EHR. It embeds advanced privacy-preserving mechanisms with collaborative learning

Cooperativity among miRNAs is reported as one strategy to overcome this constraint. Expanding the catalog of synergistic miRNAs is critical for understanding gene regulation and for developing miRNA-based therapeutics. In this study, we develop miRCoop to identify synergistic miRNA pairs that have weak or no repression on the target mRNA individually, but when act together induce strong repression. miRCoop uses kernel-based statistical interaction tests, together with miRNA and mRNA target information. We apply our approach to patient data of two different cancer types. In kidney cancer, we identify 66 putative triplets

Accurate Cell Type Quantification from Gene Expression Data | Abstract The cell type composition of heterogeneous tissue samples can be a critical variable in both clinical and laboratory settings. However, current experimental methods of cell type quantification (e.g. cell flow cytometry) are costly, time consuming and can introduce bias. Computational approaches that infer cell type abundance from expression data offer an alternate solution. While these methods have gained popularity, most are limited to predicting hematopoietic cell types and do not produce accurate predictions for stromal cell types. Many are also limited to particular platforms, whether RNA-Seq or specific microarray models. To overcome these limitations, we present the Gene Expression Deconvolution Interactive Tool, or GEDIT. Using simulated and experimental data, we demonstrate that GEDIT produces accurate results for both stromal and hematopoietic cell types

Single-Cell Multi-omics clustering.. It is an approach to identify cell clusters from data with co-measurements of scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq from the same cell. We overcome the high sparsity of the scATAC-seq data by using an imputation strategy that exploits the less-sparse scRNA-seq data available from the same cell. Subsequently, scMoC identifies clusters of cells by merging clusterings derived from both data domains individually. We tested scMoC on datasets generated using different protocols with variable data sparsity levels. We show that, due to its imputation scheme, scMoC 1) is able to generate informative scATAC-seq data due to its RNA guided imputation strategy, and 2) results in integrated clusters based on both RNA and ATAC information that are biologically meaningful either from the RNA or from the ATAC perspective.

CONSENT (Scalable long read self-correction and assembly polishing with multiple sequence alignment) is a self-correction method for long reads. It works by, first, computing overlaps between the long reads, in order to define an alignment pile (i.e. a set of overlapping reads used for correction) for each read. Each read's alignment pile is then further divided into smaller windows, that are corrected idependently. First, a multiple alignment strategy is used in order to compute consensus. Then, this consensus is further polished with a local de Bruijn graph, in order to get rid of the remaining errors. Additionally to error correction, CONSENT can also perform assembly polishing.

Fast and Accurate RNA Secondary Structure Prediction with Deep Learning.. Abstract For many RNA molecules, the secondary structure is essential for the correction function of the RNA. Predicting RNA secondary structure from nucleotide sequences is a long-standing problem in genomics, but the prediction performance has reached a plateau over time.

Here we propose a deep learning-based method, called UFold, for RNA secondary structure prediction, trained directly on annotated data without any thermodynamic assumptions

Single-Sequence-Based Protein Contact Prediction Using Deep Fully Convolutional Network.. There has been a significant improvement in protein residue contact prediction in recent years. Nevertheless, state-of-the-art methods still show deficiencies in the contact prediction of proteins with low-homology information. These top methods depend largely on statistical features that derived from homologous sequences, but previous studies, along with our analyses, show that they are insufficient for inferencing an accurate contact map for nonhomology protein targets. To compensate, we proposed a brand new single-sequence-based contact predictor (SSCpred) that performs prediction through the deep fully convolutional network (Deep FCN) with only the target sequence itself, i.e., without additional homology information. The proposed pipeline makes good use of the target sequence by utilizing the pair-wise encoding technique and Deep FCN

A Random Forest Predictor for RNA Pseudouridine Sites.. One of the ubiquitous chemical modifications in RNA, pseudouridine modification is crucial for various cellular biological and physiological processes. To gain more insight into the functional mechanisms involved, it is of fundamental importance to precisely identify pseudouridine sites in RNA. Several useful machine learning approaches have become available recently, with the increasing progress of next-generation sequencing technology; however, existing methods cannot predict sites with high accuracy. Thus, a more accurate predictor is required. In this study, a random forest-based predictor named RF-PseU is proposed for prediction of pseudouridylation sites. To optimize feature representation and obtain a better model, the light gradient boosting machine algorithm and incremental feature selection strategy were used to select the optimum feature space vector for training the random forest model RF-PseU

Identification of SNP Targeted Pathways From Genome-wide Association Study (GWAS) Data.. Abstract The identification of the variants that explain familial risk of a specific disease is important since it enables the development of genetic risk prediction tests, diagnosis tools and therapeutical applications. One possible reason of multifactorial diseases is the alterations in the activity of biological pathways, where a series of mutations occur in distinct genes. While each of these variations extends slightly the likelihood of having the disease, they work together to give birth to the perturbations in normal biological processes. We provide a protocol \(termed PANOGA, Pathway and Network Oriented GWAS \(Genome-wide association study) Analysis) to devise functionally important pathways through the identification of genes within these pathways, where these genes are targeted by single nucleotide polymorphisms \(SNPs) obtained from the GWAS analysis. ||| HOMEPAGE BROKEN!

A Scalable Lossy to Lossless Solution for NGS Sequencing Data Compression.. Per-base quality values in NGS sequencing data take a significant portion of storage even after compression. Lossy compression technologies could further reduce the space used by quality values. However, in many applications lossless compression is still desired. Hence, sequencing data in multiple file formats have to be prepared for different applications. Results We developed a scalable lossy to lossless compression solution for quality values named ScaleQC. ScaleQC is able to provide bit-stream level scalability. More specifically, the losslessly compressed bit-stream by ScaleQC can be further truncated to lower data rates without re-encoding. Despite its scalability, ScaleQC still achieves same or better compression performance at both lossless and lossy data rates compared to the state-of-the-art lossless or lossy compressors

a platform of ratiometric bioluminescent sensors for homogeneous immunoassays.. Abstract Heterogeneous immunoassays such as ELISA have become indispensable in modern bioanalysis, yet translation into easy-to-use point-of-care assays is hindered by their dependence on external calibration and multiple washing and incubation steps. Here, we introduce RAPPID ( Ra tiometric P lug-and- P lay Immuno d iagnostics), a “mix-and-measure” homogeneous immunoassay platform that combines highly specific antibody-based detection with a ratiometric bioluminescent readout that can be detected using a basic digital camera. The concept entails analyte-induced complementation of split NanoLuc luciferase fragments, photoconjugated to an antibody sandwich pair via protein G adapters. We also introduce the use of a calibrator luciferase that provides a robust ratiometric signal, allowing direct in-sample calibration and quantitative measurements in complex media such as blood plasma
a method to quantitatively assess RNA-DNA hybrid formation genome-wide.. R-loops are dynamic, co-transcriptional nucleic acid structures that facilitate physiological processes but can also cause DNA damage in certain contexts. Perturbations of transcription or R-loop resolution are expected to change their genomic distribution. Next-generation sequencing approaches to map RNA-DNA hybrids, a component of R-loops, have so far not allowed quantitative comparisons between such conditions. Here, we describe quantitative differential DNA-RNA immunoprecipitation (qDRIP), a method combining synthetic RNA-DNA-hybrid internal standards with high-resolution, strand-specific sequencing. We show that qDRIP avoids biases inherent to read-count normalization by accurately profiling signal in regions unaffected by transcription inhibition in human cells, and by facilitating accurate differential peak calling between conditions
A tool to automatically quantify Point-Of-Care Tests from images..

An Interpretable Prediction Model for Identifying N<sup>7</sup>-Methylguanosine Sites Based on XGBoost and SHAP.. Recent studies have increasingly shown that the chemical modification of mRNA plays an important role in the regulation of gene expression.

In vitro, individual approaches alone all identified stabilising variants at a rate better than expected by random selection. Low numbers of overlapping predictions between approaches meant a greater success rate was achieved (fourfold better than random) when approaches were combined and selections restricted to the highest ranked sites

An Online Prognostic Biomarker Analysis Tool for Low-Grade Glioma.. Glioma is the most frequent primary brain tumor that causes high mortality and morbidity with poor prognosis. There are four grades of gliomas, I to IV, among which grade II and III are low-grade glioma (LGG).

Current LGG treatment mainly depends on surgical resection followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy, but the survival rates of LGG patients are low. Therefore, it is necessary to use prognostic biomarkers to classify patients into subgroups with different risks and guide clinical managements. Using gene expression profiling and long-term follow-up data, we established an Online consensus Survival analysis tool for LGG named OSlgg. OSlgg is comprised of 720 LGG cases from two independent cohorts

Ridge regression (RR) is a regularization technique that penalizes the L2-norm of the coefficients in linear regression. One of the challenges of using RR is the need to set a hyperparameter (α) that controls the amount of regularization. Cross-validation is typically used to select the best α from a set of candidates. However, efficient and appropriate selection of α can be challenging, particularly where large amounts of data are analyzed. Because the selected α depends on the scale of the data and predictors, it is also not straightforwardly interpretable.. In fracridge, we reparameterize RR in terms of the ratio γ between the L2-norms of the regularized and unregularized coefficients. This approach, called fractional RR (FRR), has several benefits: the solutions obtained for different γ are guaranteed to vary, guarding against wasted calculations, and automatically span the relevant range of regularization, avoiding the need for arduous manual exploration.

To address this, we develop an interpretable deep learning method, Varmole to simultaneously reveal genomic functions and mechanisms while predicting phenotype from genotype. In particular, Varmole embeds multi-omic networks into a deep neural network architecture and prioritizes variants, genes and regulatory linkages via drop-connect without needing prior feature selections.

An integrated computational tool for identifying non-coding RNA promoters in multiple species.. The promoter is located near the transcription start sites and regulates transcription initiation of the gene. Accurate identification of promoters is essential for understanding the mechanism of gene regulation. Since experimental methods are costly and ineffective, developing efficient and accurate computational tools to identify promoters are necessary. Although a series of methods have been proposed for identifying promoters, none of them is able to identify the promoters of non-coding RNA (ncRNA). In the present work, a new method called ncPro-ML was proposed to identify the promoter of ncRNA in Homo sapiens and Mus musculus, in which different kinds of sequence encoding schemes were used to convert DNA sequences into feature vectors. To test the length effect, for each species, datasets including sequences with different lengths were built

In our module, we re-segmented the raw electrical signals based on the basecalled sequences provided by the default basecallers. By employing convolution neural networks (CNNs) and bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) networks, we took advantage of the information from the raw electrical signals and the basecalled sequences from the basecallers.

Entropy subspace separation-based clustering for noise reduction (ENCORE) of scRNA-seq data.. Single-cell RNA sequencing enables us to characterize the cellular heterogeneity in single cell resolution with the help of cell type identification algorithms. However, the noise inherent in single-cell RNA-sequencing data severely disturbs the accuracy of cell clustering, marker identification and visualization.

We named such strategy as 'entropy subspace' separation and designed a cell clustering algorithm called ENtropy subspace separation-based Clustering for nOise REduction (ENCORE) by integrating the 'entropy subspace' separation strategy with a consensus clustering method. We demonstrate that ENCORE performs superiorly on cell clustering and generates high-resolution visualization across 12 standard datasets

ThresholdNet with Confidence-Guided Manifold Mixup for Polyp Segmentation.. The automatic segmentation of polyp in endoscopy images is crucial for early diagnosis and cure of colorectal cancer. Existing deep learning-based methods for polyp segmentation, however, are inadequate due to the limited annotated dataset and the class imbalance problems. Moreover, these methods obtained the final polyp segmentation results by simply thresholding the likelihood maps at an eclectic and equivalent value (often set to 0.5). In this paper, we propose a novel ThresholdNet with a confidence-guided manifold mixup (CGMMix) data augmentation method, mainly for addressing the aforementioned issues in polyp segmentation. The CGMMix conducts manifold mixup at the image and feature levels, and adaptively lures the decision boundary away from the under-represented polyp class with the confidence guidance to alleviate the limited training dataset and the class imbalance problems

ThreaderAI first employs deep learning to predict residue-residue aligning probability matrix by integrating sequence profile, predicted sequential structural features, and predicted residue-residue contacts, and then builds template-query alignment by applying a dynamic programming algorithm on the probability matrix.
automated ImageJ retinal layer thickness and profile in digital images.. To develop an automated retina layer thickness measurement tool for the ImageJ platform, to quantitate nuclear layers following the retina contour. We developed the ThicknessTool (TT), an automated thickness measurement plugin for the ImageJ platform. To calibrate TT, we created a calibration dataset of mock binary skeletonized mask images with increasing thickness masks and different rotations. Following, we created a training dataset and performed an agreement analysis of thickness measurements between TT and two masked manual observers. Finally, we tested the performance of TT measurements in a validation dataset of retinal detachment images. In the calibration dataset, there were no differences in layer thickness between measured and known thickness masks, with an overall coefficient of variation of 0.00%
transcriptome-driven efficacy estimates for gene-based TArget discovery.. Estimating efficacy of gene-target-disease associations is a fundamental step in drug discovery. An important data source for this laborious task is RNA expression, which can provide gene-disease associations on the basis of expression fold change and statistical significance. However, the simply use of the log-fold change can lead to numerous false-positive associations. On the other hand, more sophisticated methods that utilize gene co-expression networks do not consider tissue specificity. Here, we introduce Transcriptome-driven Efficacy estimates for gene-based TArget discovery (ThETA), an R package that enables non-expert users to use novel efficacy scoring methods for drug-target discovery. In particular, ThETA allows users to search for gene perturbation (therapeutics) that reverse disease-gene expression and genes that are closely related to disease-genes in tissue-specific networks

Multi-Objective Matrix Normalization for Fine-grained Visual Recognition.. Bilinear pooling achieves great success in fine-grained visual recognition (FGVC). Recent methods have shown that the matrix power normalization can stabilize the second-order information in bilinear features, but some problems, e.g., redundant information and over-fitting, remain to be resolved. In this paper, we propose an efficient Multi-Objective Matrix Normalization (MOMN) method that can simultaneously normalize a bilinear representation in terms of square-root, low-rank, and sparsity. These three regularizers can not only stabilize the second-order information, but also compact the bilinear features and promote model generalization. In MOMN, a core challenge is how to jointly optimize three non-smooth regularizers of different convex properties. To this end, MOMN first formulates them into an augmented Lagrange formula with approximated regularizer constraints

An R package to identify sudden gains in longitudinal data.. Sudden gains are large and stable improvements in an outcome variable between consecutive measurements, for example during a psychological intervention with multiple assessments. Researching these occurrences could help understand individual change processes in longitudinal data. Three criteria are generally used to identify sudden gains in psychological interventions. However, applying these criteria can be time consuming and prone to errors if not fully automated. Adaptations to these criteria and methodological decisions such as how multiple gains are handled vary across studies and are reported with different levels of detail. These problems limit the comparability of individual studies and make it hard to understand or replicate the exact methods used. The R package suddengains provides a set of tools to facilitate sudden gains research

Flexible Visualization Design through Data-Agnostic and Reusable Graphical Structures.. Information visualization research has developed powerful systems that enable users to author custom data visualizations without textual programming. These systems can support graphics-driven practices by bridging lazy data-binding mechanisms with vector-graphics editing tools.

A Federated, Privacy-Preserving Tool as a Robust Alternative to Meta-Analysis in Genome-Wide Association Studies.. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been widely used to unravel connections between genetic variants and diseases.

Cortical surface registration using unsupervised learning.. Non-rigid cortical registration is an important and challenging task due to the geometric complexity of the human cortex and the high degree of inter-subject variability. A conventional solution is to use a spherical representation of surface properties and perform registration by aligning cortical folding patterns in that space. This strategy produces accurate spatial alignment, but often requires high computational cost. Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated the potential to dramatically speed up volumetric registration. However, due to distortions introduced by projecting a sphere to a 2D plane, a direct application of recent learning-based methods to surfaces yields poor results. In this study, we present SphereMorph, a diffeomorphic registration framework for cortical surfaces using deep networks that addresses these issues

Methods:In this study, we developed a novel signaling pathway analysis method called signaling pathway functional attributes analysis (SPFA) method. This method analyzes the signal variations that effector genes received between two conditions (normal and disease) in different signaling pathways

A cross-platform normalization method for gene expression data integration.. MOTIVATION:Combining gene expression (GE) profiles generated from different platforms enables previously infeasible studies due to sample size limitations. Several cross-platform normalization methods have been developed to remove the systematic differences between platforms, but they may also remove meaningful biological differences among datasets. In this work, we propose a novel approach that removes the platform, not the biological differences. Dubbed as 'MatchMixeR', we model platform differences by a linear mixed effects regression (LMER) model, and estimate them from matched GE profiles of the same cell line or tissue measured on different platforms. The resulting model can then be used to remove platform differences in other datasets

A New Ensemble Adversarial Attack Powered by Long-Term Gradient Memories.. Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. More importantly, some adversarial examples crafted against an ensemble of source models transfer to other target models and, thus, pose a security threat to black-box applications (when attackers have no access to the target models). Current transfer-based ensemble attacks, however, only consider a limited number of source models to craft an adversarial example and, thus, obtain poor transferability. Besides, recent query-based black-box attacks, which require numerous queries to the target model, not only come under suspicion by the target model but also cause expensive query cost. In this article, we propose a novel transfer-based black-box attack, dubbed serial-minigroup-ensemble-attack (SMGEA)

An Application to the Prediction of Pro-/Anti- Longevity Genes.. Understanding the ageing process is a very challenging problem for biologists. To help in this task, there has been a growing use of classification methods (from machine learning) to learn models that predict whether a gene influences the process of ageing or promotes longevity. One type of predictive feature often used for learning such classification models is Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) features. One important property of PPI features is their uncertainty, i.e., a given feature (PPI annotation) is often associated with a confidence score, which is usually ignored by conventional classification methods. Hence, we propose the Lazy Feature Selection for Uncertain Features (LFSUF) method, which is tailored for coping with the uncertainty in PPI confidence scores

Candidate Cancer-Related lncRNA Prioritization via Integrating Multiple Biological Networks.. Identification and characterization of lncRNAs in cancer with a view to their application in improving diagnosis and therapy remains a major challenge that requires new and innovative approaches. We have developed an integrative framework termed "CLING", aimed to prioritize candidate cancer-related lncRNAs based on their associations with known cancer lncRNAs. CLING focuses on joint optimization and prioritization of all candidates for each cancer type by integrating lncRNA topological properties and multiple lncRNA-centric networks. Validation analyses revealed that CLING is more effective than prioritization based on a single lncRNA network. Reliable AUC (Area Under Curve) scores were obtained across 10 cancer types, ranging from 0.85 to 0.94. Several novel lncRNAs predicted in the top 10 candidates for various cancer types have been confirmed by recent biological experiments

A local consistency approach for nutrigenomics data analysis.. Nutrigenomics aims at understanding the interaction between nutrition and gene information. Due to the complex interactions of nutrients and genes, their relationship exhibits non-linearity. One of the most effective and efficient methods to explore their relationship is the nutritional geometry framework which fits a response surface for the gene expression over two prespecified nutrition variables. However, when the number of nutrients involved is large, it is challenging to find combinations of informative nutrients with respect to a certain gene and to test whether the relationship is stronger than chance. Methods for identifying informative combinations are essential to understanding the relationship between nutrients and genes.<h4>Results< h4>We introduce Local Consistency Nutrition to Graphics (LC-N2G), a novel approach for ranking and identifying combinations of nutrients with gene expression

Identification of lncRNAs subcellular localization with multiple features and nonnegative matrix factorization.. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) refer to functional RNA molecules with a length more than 200 nucleotides and have minimal or no function to encode proteins. In recent years, more studies show that lncRNAs subcellular localization has valuable clues for their biological functions. So it is count for much to identify lncRNAs subcellular localization. In this paper, a novel statistical model named KD-KLNMF is constructed to predict lncRNAs subcellular localization. Firstly, k-mer and dinucleotide-based spatial autocorrelation are incorporated as the feature vector. Then, Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique is used to deal with the imbalance dataset. Next, Kullback-Leibler divergence-based nonnegative matrix factorization is applied to select optimal features. And then we utilize support vector machine as the classifier after comparing with other classifiers

Joint Integration and Discrimination for Automated Single-Cell Annotation.. JIND is a framework for automated cell-type identification based on neural networks. It directly learns a low-dimensional representation (latent code) inwhich cell-types can be reliably determined. To account for batch effects, JIND performs a novel asymmetric alignment in which the transcriptomic profileof unseen cells is mapped onto the previously learned latent space, hence avoiding the need of retraining the model whenever a new dataset becomes available. JIND also learns cell-type-specific confidence thresholds to identify and reject cells that cannot be reliably classified. We show on datasets with and without batch effects that JIND classifies cells more accurately than previously proposed methods while rejecting only a small proportion of cells. Moreover, JIND batch alignment is parallelizable, being more than five or six times faster than Seurat integration.

A Fast, Automated, and Interactive Server to Derive Torsional Dihedral Potentials for Classical Molecular Simulations.. The Rotational Profiler attempts to facilitate the task of performing this overall fit. The functional torsional form used in the code is.. There is a very fundamental difference in the use of torsional potential functions as compared to bond length and angle potentials. Only a small subset of the full potential energy domain, around the minumum, is realized in the parabolic-like bond length and angle potentials. Therefore the emphasis in fitting these potentials is to reproduce potential near the minimum, with not so much concern about the functional form, or parameterization, or large excursions from equilibrium because they are energetically disallowed.. On the other hand, torsional potentials are evaluated over the full 360° of rotation around a bond.

efficient indexing of k-mer presence and abundance in sequencing datasets.. REINDEER builds a data-structure that indexes k-mers and their abundances in a collection of datasets (raw RNA-seq or metagenomic reads for instance). Then, a sequence (FASTA) can be queried for its presence and abundance in each indexed dataset. While other tools (e.g. SBT, BIGSI) were also designed for large-scale k-mer presence/absence queries, retrieving abundances was so far unsupported (except for single datasets, e.g. using some k-mer counters like KMC, Jellyfish). REINDEER combines fast queries, small index size, and low memory footprint during indexing and queries. We showed it allows to index 2585 RNA-seq datasets (~4 billions k-mers) using less than 60GB of RAM and a final index size lower than 60GB on the disk. Then, a REINDEER index can either be queried on disk (experimental feature, low RAM usage) or be loaded in RAM for faster queries.

A Computational Framework for Identifying Allele-Specific Transcription Factor Binding From ATAC-seq Data.. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis is useful for identifying genetic variants correlated with gene expression, however, it cannot distinguish between causal and nearby non-functional variants. Because the majority of disease-associated SNPs are located in regulatory regions, they can impact allele-specific binding (ASB) of transcription factors and result in differential expression of the target gene alleles. In this study, our aim was to identify functional single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that alter transcriptional regulation and thus, potentially impact cellular function. Here, we present regSNPs-ASB, a generalized linear model-based approach to identify regulatory SNPs that are located in transcription factor binding sites

A genome-guided transcriptome assembler using sparse flow decomposition.. High throughput sequencing of RNA (RNA-Seq) has become a staple in modern molecular biology, with applications not only in quantifying gene expression but also in isoform-level analysis of the RNA transcripts. To enable such an isoform-level analysis, a transcriptome assembly algorithm is utilized to stitch together the observed short reads into the corresponding transcripts. This task is complicated due to the complexity of alternative splicing - a mechanism by which the same gene may generate multiple distinct RNA transcripts. We develop a novel genome-guided transcriptome assembler, RefShannon, that exploits the varying abundances of the different transcripts, in enabling an accurate reconstruction of the transcripts. Our evaluation shows RefShannon is able to improve sensitivity effectively (up to 22%) at a given specificity in comparison with other state-of-the-art assemblers
A fast and efficient long-read genome assembly approach for large and complex genomes..

We have developed RefKA, a reference-based approach for long read genome assembly. This approach relies on breaking up a closely related reference genome into bins, aligning k-mers unique to each bin with PacBio reads, and then assembling each bin in parallel followed by a final bin-stitching step.

For this, next-generation sequencing (NGS) based approaches promise the determination of variants even at low frequencies. However, accurate methods for a valid detection of low-frequency variants in NGS data are currently lacking. To tackle this problem, we developed the variant detection tool binoSNP which allows the determination of low-frequency single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in NGS datasets from Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) strains.
The binomialRF package is an R package that provides a feature selection algorithm to be used in randomForest classifiers. Treating each tree as a quasi binomial stochastic process in a random forest, binomialRF determines a feature’s importance by how often they are selected in practice vs. as expected by random chance. Given that trees are co-dependent as they subsample the same data, a theoretical adjustment is made using a generalization of the binomial distribution that adds a parameter to model correlation/association between trials.

A fast and accurate method for polyploid haplotype reconstruction.. Reconstructing haplotypes from sequencing data is one of the major challenges in genetics. Haplotypes play a crucial role in many analyses, including genome-wide association studies and population genetics. Haplotype reconstruction becomes more difficult for higher numbers of homologous chromosomes, as it is often the case for polyploid plants. This complexity is compounded further by higher heterozygosity, which denotes the frequent presence of variants between haplotypes. We have designed Ranbow, a new tool for haplotype reconstruction of polyploid genome from short read sequencing data. Ranbow integrates all types of small variants in bi- and multi-allelic sites to reconstruct haplotypes. To evaluate Ranbow and currently available competing methods on real data, we have created and released a real gold standard dataset from sweet potato sequencing data

Characterization and Identification of Lysine Phosphoglycerylation Sites Based on Sequence-Based Features.. iDPGK is a web server for identifying phosphoglycerylation sites. Protein phosphoglycerylation is the reaction in which a 1,3-bisphosphoglyceric acid (1,3-BPG) is attached to a lysine residue of a protein molecule, and thus to form a 3-phosphoglyceryl-lysine (pgK). Phosphoglycerylation is a reversible and non-enzymatic post-translational modification (PTM). It has been shown that the process of lysine phosphoglycerylation plays important regulatory roles in glucose metabolism and glycolytic process. However, studies in this field have been limited by the difficulty of experimentally identifying modified site specificity in lysine phosphoglycerylation (PGK).. To facilitate this process, several tools have been proposed for the computational identification of PGK sites.

Sequence-based Detection of DNA-binding Proteins using Multiple-view Features Allied with Feature Selection.. DNA-binding proteins play essential roles in many molecular functions and gene regulation. Therefore, it becomes highly desirable to develop effective computational techniques for detecting DNA-binding proteins. In this paper, we proposed a new method, iDBP-DEP, which performs DNA-binding prediction by using the discriminative feature derived from multi-view feature sources including evolutionary profile, dipeptide composition, and physicochemical properties with feature selection. We evaluated iDBP-DEP on two benchmark datasets, i. e., PDB1075 and PDB594 by rigorous Jackknife test. Compared with the state-of-the-art sequence-based DNA-binding predictors, the proposed iDBP-DEP achieved 1.8 % and 3.0 % improvements of accuracy (Acc) and Mathew's Correlation Coefficient (MCC), respectively, on PDB1075 dataset; 7.4 % and 14.8 % improvements of Acc and MCC, respectively, on PDB594

To study cartilage degeneration, researchers have developed algorithms to segment femoral knee cartilage from magnetic resonance (MR) images and to measure cartilage morphology and relaxometry. The majority of these algorithms are not publicly available or require advanced programming skills to be compiled and run. However, to accelerate discoveries and findings, it is crucial to have open and reproducible workflows. We present pyKNEEr, a framework for open and reproducible research on femoral knee cartilage from MR images. pyKNEEr is written in python, uses Jupyter notebook as a user interface, and is available on GitHub with a GNU GPLv3 license

Python Application for Computing Graph Traversal Edit Distance.. Graph Traversal Edit Distance (GTED) is a measure of distance (or dissimilarity) between two graphs introduced. This measure is based on the minimum edit distance between two strings formed by the edge labels of respective Eulerian traversals of the two graphs. GTED was motivated by and provides the first mathematical formalism for sequence coassembly and de novo variation detection in bioinformatics. Many problems in applied machine learning deal with graphs (also called networks), including social networks, security, web data mining, protein function prediction, and genome informatics. The kernel paradigm beautifully decouples the learning algorithm from the underlying geometric space, which renders graph kernels important for the aforementioned applications. In this article, we introduce a tool, PyGTED to compute GTED

Learning Pixel-wise Warping Maps for Video Stabilization.. As the videos captured by hand-held cameras are often perturbed by high-frequency jitters, stabilization of these videos is an essential task. Many video stabilization methods have been proposed to stabilize shaky videos. However, most methods estimate one global homography or several homographies based on fixed meshes to warp the shaky frames into their stabilized views. Due to the existence of parallax, such single or a few homographies can not well handle the depth variation. In contrast to these traditional methods, we propose a novel video stabilization network, called PWStableNet, which comes up pixel-wise warping maps, i.e., potentially different warping for different pixels, and stabilizes each pixel to its stabilized view. To our best knowledge, this is the first deep learning based pixel-wise video stabilization

prediction of driver frameshift indels in human cancer.. The discrimination of driver from passenger mutations has been a hot topic in the field of cancer biology. Although recent advances have improved the identification of driver mutations in cancer genomic research, there is no computational method specific for the cancer frameshift indels (insertions or and deletions) yet. In addition, existing pathogenic frameshift indel predictors may suffer from plenty of missing values because of different choices of transcripts during the variant annotation processes. In this study, we proposed a computational model, called PredCID (Predictor for Cancer driver frameshift InDels), for accurately predicting cancer driver frameshift indels. Gene, DNA, transcript and protein level features are combined together and selected for classification with eXtreme Gradient Boosting classifier

an R package for power assessment in microbiome case-control studies.. power assessment in microbiome case-control studies.. Power analysis is essential to decide the sample size of metagenomic sequencing experiments in a case-control study for identifying differentially abundant microbes. However, the complexity of microbiome data characteristics such as excessive zeros, over-dispersion, compositional effect, intrinsically microbial correlations and variable sequencing depths makes the power analysis particularly challenging as the analytical form is usually unavailable. Here, we develop a simulation-based strategy and R package powmic to estimate the empirical statistical power while considering the complexity of data characteristics.
Post-prediction inference.. Many modern problems leverage machine learning methods to predict outcomes based on observable covariates.

RNA-Seq analysis using approximate likelihood.. Polee is an alternative methodology for the analysis of RNA-Seq data. A lot of RNA-Seq analyses do not consider the full likelihood, but instead take a two-step approach of first estimating transcript or gene expression then treating those estimates as observations in subsequent analysis. This is more efficient than a full probabilistic model encompassing all the reads in the experiment, but does not fully account for uncertainty. To overcome this shortcoming Polee makes a compact and efficient approximation of the likelihood function, and substitutes it in place of the real thing. The end result is more accurate analysis of RNA-Seq (e.g., differential expression) while remaining tractable on inexpensive computers.
a Technique to Discover Single-cell Biomarker Using 2D Visual Information.. In this work, we design the Polar Gini Curve (PGC) technique, which combines the gene expression and the 2D embedded visual information to detect biomarkers from single-cell data. Theoretically, a Polar Gini Curve characterizes the shape and ‘evenness’ of cell-point distribution of cell-point set. To quantify whether a gene could be a marker in a cell cluster, we can combine two Polar Gini Curves: one drawn upon the cell-points expressing the gene, and the other drawn upon all cell-points in the cluster. We hypothesize that the closers these two curves are, the more likely the gene would be cluster markers. We demonstrate the framework in several simulation case-studies. Applying our framework in analyzing neonatal mouse heart single-cell data, the detected biomarkers may characterize novel subtypes of cardiac muscle cells

Combining local methods and diffusion state embeddings to predict missing interactions in biological networks.. MOTIVATION:One of the core problems in the analysis of biological networks is the link prediction problem. In particular, existing interactions networks are noisy and incomplete snapshots of the true network, with many true links missing because those interactions have not yet been experimentally observed. Methods to predict missing links have been more extensively studied for social than for biological networks; it was recently argued that there is some special structure in protein-protein interaction (PPI) network data that might mean that alternate methods may outperform the best methods for social networks. Based on a generalization of the diffusion state distance, we design a new embedding-based link prediction method called global and local integrated diffusion embedding (GLIDE)

SyRI is tool for finding genomic rearrangements and local sequence differences from whole-genome assemblies.. Genomic differences range from single nucleotide differences to complex structural variations. Current methods typically annotate sequence differences ranging from SNPs to large indels accurately but do not unravel the full complexity of structural rearrangements, including inversions, translocations, and duplications, where highly similar sequence changes in location, orientation, or copy number. Here, we present SyRI, a pairwise whole-genome comparison tool for chromosome-level assemblies. SyRI starts by finding rearranged regions and then searches for differences in the sequences, which are distinguished for residing in syntenic or rearranged regions. This distinction is important as rearranged regions are inherited differently compared to syntenic regions.

Subjective Evaluation of the Spectral Temporal SIMilarity (ST-SIM) Measure for Vibrotactile Quality Assessment.. Recent standardization efforts for Tactile Internet (TI) and haptic codecs have paved the route for delivering tactile experiences in synchrony with audio and visual interaction components. Since humans are the ultimate consumers of tactile interactions, it is utmost important to develop objective quality assessment measures that are in close agreements with human perception. In this work, we present the results of a large-scale subjective study of a recently proposed objective quality assessment approach for vibrotactile signals called ST-SIM (Spectral Temporal SIMilarity). ST-SIM encompasses two components: perceptual spectral and temporal similarity measures. Two subjective experiments were conducted to validate ST-SIM, and elicited subjective ratings are used to create a VibroTactile Quality Assessment (VTQA) database.
SSEThread  is an Integrative threading of the DNA-PKcs sequence based on data from chemical cross-linking and hydrogen deuterium exchange.. X-ray crystallography and electron microscopy maps resolved to 3-8 Å are generally sufficient for tracing the path of the polypeptide chain in space, while often insufficient for unambiguously registering the sequence on the path (i.e., threading). Frequently, however, additional information is available from other biophysical experiments, physical principles, statistical analyses, and other prior models. Here, we formulate an integrative approach for sequence assignment to a partial backbone model as an optimization problem, which requires three main components: the representation of the system, the scoring function, and the optimization method.
To Improve Protein Sequence Profile Prediction through Image Captioning on Pairwise Residue Distance Map.. Protein sequence profile prediction aims to generate multiple sequences from structural information to advance the protein design. Protein sequence profile can be computationally predicted by energy-based method or fragment-based methods. By integrating these methods with neural networks, our previous method, SPIN2 has achieved a sequence recovery rate of 34%. However, SPIN2 employed only one dimensional (1D) structural properties that are not sufficient to represent 3D structures. In this study, we represented 3D structures by 2D maps of pairwise residue distances. and developed a new method (SPROF) to predict protein sequence profile based on an image captioning learning frame. To our best knowledge, this is the first method to employ 2D distance map for predicting protein properties.

Here, we propose a new method, called SourceSet, able to distinguish between the primary and the secondary dysregulation within a Gaussian graphical model context. The proposed method compares gene expression profiles in the control and in the perturbed condition and detects the differences in both the mean and the covariance parameters with a series of likelihood ratio tests.

A GRASS tool for the Sediment Delivery Ratio mapping.. This work involves a tool implementation for evaluating Sediment Delivery Ratio (SDR) in a river basin, through GRASS GIS software. The definition of a spatially distributed value of SDR is a very important task as the sediment routing can affects solid transport in stream channels, water quality degradation, and frequency increase of natural disasters such as debris flows and mudflows. For such reason the SDR evaluation, coupled with GIS approach, has been extensively used in scientific literature. Geographic information systems provide a fundamental support for a better prediction of SDR, since it can consider the space variability of factors influencing the sediment routing processes. Actually a specific GIS module to estimate the spatial variability of SDR does not exist.

Kernel-based method for estimating isotopic niche size and overlap.. The isotopic niche of consumers represents biologically relevant information on resource and habitat use. Several tools have been developed to quantify niche size and overlap. Nonetheless, methods adapted by spatial ecologists to quantify animal home ranges can be modified for use in stable isotope ecology when data are not normally distributed in bivariate space.

A wisdom of the crowd-based Gene Ontology annotation tool | Abstract Motivation Protein function prediction tools vary widely in their methodologies, resulting in different sets of GO terms being correctly predicted. Ideally, multiple tools are combined to achieve a higher recall of GO terms while increasing precision. Results CrowdGO combines input predictions from any number of tools and combines them based on the Gene Ontology Directed Acyclic Graph. Using each GO terms information content, the semantic similarity between GO predictions of different tools, and a Support Vector Machine model, it achieves improved precision and recall compared to each of the tools separately (Figure 1). Availability CrowdGO can be found at https: gitlab.com mreijnders CrowdGO
Genome-wide association analysis of age-at-onset traits using Cox mixed-effects models | Abstract Age-at-onset is one of the critical phenotypes in cohort studies of age-related diseases. Large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of age-at-onset can provide more insights into genetic effects on disease progression, and transitions between different stages. Moreover, proportional hazards or Cox regression generally achieves higher statistical power in a cohort study than a binary trait using logistic regression. Although mixed-effects models are widely used in GWAS to correct for population stratification and family structure, application of Cox mixed-effects models (CMEMs) to large-scale GWAS are so far hindered by intractable computational intensity. In this work, we propose COXMEG, an efficient R package for conducting GWAS of age-at-onset using CMEMs
Community predictions of hubs in gene regulatory networks.. Abstract Summary Hub transcription factors, regulating many target genes in gene regulatory networks (GRNs), play important roles as disease regulators and potential drug targets. However, while numerous methods have been developed to predict individual regulator-gene interactions from gene expression data, few methods focus on inferring these hubs. We have developed ComHub, a tool to predict hubs in GRNs. ComHub makes a community prediction of hubs by averaging over predictions by a compendium of network inference methods. Benchmarking ComHub to the DREAM5 challenge data and an independent data set of human gene expression, proved a robust performance of ComHub over all data sets. Lastly, we implemented ComHub to work with both predefined networks and to do standard network inference, which we believe will make it generally applicable

A multifunctional R package for identification of tumor-specific neoantigens.. Abstract It is known that some mutated peptides, such as those resulting from missense mutations and frameshift insertions, can bind to the major histocompatibility complex and be presented to antitumor T-cells on the surface of a tumor cell. These peptides are termed neoantigen and it is important to understand this process for cancer immunotherapy. Here, we introduce an R package that can predict a list of potential neoantigens from a variety of mutations, which include not only somatic point mutations but insertions, deletions, and structural variants.
Populating Chemical Space with Peptides using a Genetic Algorithm.. In drug discovery one uses chemical space as a concept to organize molecules according to their structures and properties.

PySpacell is a Python Package for Spatial Analysis of Cell Images.. Technologies such as microscopy, sequential hybridization, and mass spectrometry enable quantitative single-cell phenotypic and molecular measurements in situ. Deciphering spatial phenotypic and molecular effects on the single-cell level is one of the grand challenges and a key to understanding the effects of cell-cell interactions and microenvironment. However, spatial information is usually overlooked by downstream data analyses, which usually consider single-cell read-out values as independent measurements for further averaging or clustering, thus disregarding spatial locations. With this work, we attempt to fill this gap. We developed a toolbox that allows one to test for the presence of a spatial effect in microscopy images of adherent cells and estimate the spatial scale of this effect.

An automatic pipeline for macaque functional MRI preprocessing.. Non-human primate functional MRI (fMRI) is a growing field in neuroscience. However, there is no standardized method for monkey fMRI data analysis, specifically for data preprocessing. The preprocessing of monkey fMRI data is challenged by several technical and experimental specificities of the monkey research such as artifacts related to body movements or to intracranial leads. Here we propose to address these challenges by developing a new versatile pipeline for macaque fMRI preprocessing. We developed a Python module, Pypreclin, to process raw images using state of the art algorithms embedded in a fully automatic pipeline. To evaluate its robustness, we applied Pypreclin to fMRI data acquired at 3T in both awake and anesthetized macaques, with or without iron oxide contrast agent, using single loop or multichannel phased-array coils, combined or not with intracranial implanted electrodes.

PhySigs uses the input of a phylogeny with nodes representing clones in a patient tumor, a signature matrix containing the set of mutational signatures to use in the analysis, and a feature matrix for the set of mutations introduced in each clone. In particular, the mutational categories in the feature matrix should correspond to the mutational categories used in the signature matrix. . PhySigs automatically computes the count matrix, as it is simply a diagonal matrix containing the sum of columns in the feature matrix. PhySigs then solves the Tree-constrained Exposure (TE) problem for all possible clusterings of the clones that correspond to a partition of the phylogeny. The output of the TE problem is a relative exposure matrix composed of groups of identical columns corresponding to clusters of clones with identical exposures (denoted by blue and yellow). Edges between these clusters in the phylogeny are interpreted to be where exposure shifts occurred (denoted by a lightning bolt).

A hybrid and scalable error correction algorithm for indel and substitution errors of long reads.. BACKGROUND:Long-read sequencing has shown the promises to overcome the short length limitations of second-generation sequencing by providing more complete assembly. However, the computation of the long sequencing reads is challenged by their higher error rates (e.g., 13% vs. 1%) and higher cost ($0.3 vs. $0.03 per Mbp) compared to the short reads. METHODS:In this paper, we present a new hybrid error correction tool, called ParLECH (Parallel Long-read Error Correction using Hybrid methodology). The error correction algorithm of ParLECH is distributed in nature and efficiently utilizes the k-mer coverage information of high throughput Illumina short-read sequences to rectify the PacBio long-read sequences.

Determining significance of total overlap length between genomic regions sets.. MOTIVATION:Various bioinformatics analyses provide sets of genomic coordinates of interest. Whether two such sets possess a functional relation is a frequent question. This is often determined by interpreting the statistical significance of their overlaps. However, only few existing methods consider the lengths of the overlap, and they do not provide a resolutive p-value. RESULTS:Here, we introduce OLOGRAM, which performs overlap statistics between sets of genomic regions described in BEDs or GTF. It uses Monte Carlo simulation, taking into account both the distributions of region and inter-region lengths, to fit a negative binomial model of the total overlap length. Exclusion of user-defined genomic areas during the shuffling is supported.

A novel one-class classification approach to accurately predict disease-gene association in acute myeloid leukemia cancer.. Disease causing gene identification is considered as an important step towards drug design and drug discovery. In disease gene identification and classification, the main aim is to identify disease genes while identifying non-disease genes are of less or no significant. Hence, this task can be defined as a one-class classification problem. Existing machine learning methods typically take into consideration known disease genes as positive training set and unknown genes as negative samples to build a binary-class classification model. Here we propose a new One-class Classification Support Vector Machines (OCSVM) method to precisely classify candidate disease genes.

We used the Lasso Cox regression model to identify independent risk factors for long-term survival and to develop a predictive nomogram for survival and a web-based survival rate calculator. RESULTS:The median (mean) follow-up time was 30 months (52.8 months). Cancer-specific survival rates decreased with time, while the 5-year conditional survival increased with time
Predicting protein subcellular location using learned distributed representations from a protein-protein network | Predicting protein subcellular location using node embedding | we present a deep learning based method, node2loc, to predict protein subcellular location. node2loc first learns distributed representations of proteins in a protein-protein network, which acquires representations from unlabeled data for downstream tasks. Then the learned representations are further fed into a recurrent neural network (RNN) to predict subcellular locations | To identify the functions of a protein, we first need know where this protein is located. Interacting proteins tend to locate in the same subcellular location. Thus, it is imperative to take the protein-protein interactions into account for computational identification of protein subcellular locations

A random forest method for prediction of N-Glycosylation sites in eukaryotic protein sequence.. N-Glycosylation is one of the most important post-translational mechanisms in eukaryotes. It plays a vital role in various biological processes such as protein folding, stability, immunogenicity of different proteins, cell signaling and protein targeting. N-glycosylation predominantly occurs in N-X-[S T] sequon where X is any amino acid other than proline. However, not all N-X-[S T] sequons in proteins are glycosylated. Therefore, accurate prediction of N-glycosylation sites is essential to understand N-glycosylation mechanism. We developed a random forest method, Nglyc, to predict N-glycosylation sites in eukaryotic protein sequences. The method used 315 features derived from a protein sequence and its sequence homologs. Training and testing was performed using a dataset containing 895 N-glycosylation sites and 853 non-glycosylated sites obtained from 846 PDB structures

NanoCaller for accurate detection of SNPs and small indels from long-read sequencing by deep neural networks.. Abstract Background Variant detection from high-throughput sequencing data remains an important, unresolved yet often overlooked problem. Long-read sequencing technologies, such as Oxford Nanopore and PacBio sequencing, present unique advantages to detect SNPs and small indels in genomic regions that short-read sequencing cannot reliably examine (for example, only ∼80% of genomic regions are marked as “high-confidence region” to have SNP indel calls in the Genome In A Bottle project). However, existing software tools for short-read data perform poorly on long-read data; instead, several recent studies showed promising results in variant detection on long-read data by deep learning.

An Open-Source Library and Web App that Runs AutoDock Vina Entirely in the Web Browser.. 1 Abstract Molecular docking is a computational technique for predicting how a small molecule might bind a macromolecular target. Among docking programs, AutoDock Vina is particularly popular. Like many docking programs, Vina requires users to download install an executable file and to run that file from a Unix- or DOS-like command-line interface. Choosing proper configuration parameters and analyzing Vina output is also sometimes challenging. These issues are particularly problematic for students and novice researchers. We have created Webina, a new version of Vina, to address these challenges. Webina is a JavaScript WebAssembly library that runs AutoDock Vina entirely in a web browser. To use Webina, users need only visit a Webina-enabled webpage. The docking calculations take place on the user’s own computer rather than a remote server

weighted bipartite network projection for microRNA-disease association prediction | BACKGROUND:Recently, numerous biological experiments have indicated that microRNAs (miRNAs) play critical roles in exploring the pathogenesis of various human diseases. Since traditional experimental methods for miRNA-disease associations detection are costly and time-consuming, it becomes urgent to design efficient and robust computational techniques for identifying undiscovered interactions. METHODS:In this paper, we proposed a computation framework named weighted bipartite network projection for miRNA-disease association prediction (WBNPMD). In this method, transfer weights were constructed by combining the known miRNA and disease similarities, and the initial information was properly configured. Then the two-step bipartite network algorithm was implemented to infer potential miRNA-disease associations

Untargeted Metabolomics Feature Clustering Approach for Clinical Breath Gas Chromatography.. Metabolic profiling of breath analysis involves processing, alignment, scaling and clustering of thousands of features ex-tracted from Gas Chromatography Mass spectrometry (GC-MS) data from hundreds of participants. The multi-step data processing is complicated, operator error-prone and time-consuming. Automated algorithmic clustering methods that are able to cluster features in a fast and reliable way are necessary. These accelerate metabolic profiling and discovery plat-forms for next generation medical diagnostic tools. Our unsupervised clustering technique, VOCCluster, prototyped in Py-thon, handles features of deconvolved GC-MS breath data. VOCCluster was created from a heuristic ontology based on the observation of experts undertaking data processing with a suite of software packages.

An innovative visualization R package to ensure behavioral raw data reliability and transparency.. Background In recent years, the scientific community encouraged the use of raw data graphs to improve the reliability and transparency of the results presented in papers. However, methods to visualize raw data are limited to one variable per graph and or only small samples. In behavioral science as in many other fields, multiple variables need to be plotted together to allow insights of the behavior or the process observations. In this paper, we present ViSiElse, an R-package offering a new approach in raw data visualization. Methods. ViSiElse was developed with the open-source software R to provide a solution for the complete visualization of the raw time data. Results. ViSiElse grants a global overview of a process by combining the visualization of multiple actions timestamps for all participants in a single graph. Individuals and or group behavior can easily be assessed

A parallel architecture for very high-speed assessment of sequencing quality metrics | BACKGROUND:High throughput DNA RNA sequencing has revolutionized biological and clinical research. Sequencing is widely used, and generates very large amounts of data, mainly due to reduced cost and advanced technologies. Quickly assessing the quality of giga-to-tera base levels of sequencing data has become a routine but important task. Identification and elimination of low-quality sequence data is crucial for reliability of downstream analysis results. There is a need for a high-speed tool that uses optimized parallel programming for batch processing and simply gauges the quality of sequencing data from multiple datasets independent of any other processing steps. RESULTS:FQStat is a stand-alone, platform-independent software tool that assesses the quality of FASTQ files using parallel programming

Mutation hotspots identified have significantly higher mutation recurrence compared to the background genomic mutation rate, suggesting positive selection in cancer and involvement in tumorigenesis
A multifaceted gateway for exploring integrative pan-cancer genomic data.. Somatic mutation and gene expression dysregulation are considered two major tumorigenesis factors. While independent investigations of either factor pervade, studies of associations between somatic mutations and gene expression changes have been sporadic and nonsystematic. Utilizing genomic data collected from 11 315 subjects of 33 distinct cancer types, we constructed MutEx, a pan-cancer integrative genomic database. This database records the relationships among gene expression, somatic mutation and survival data for cancer patients. MutEx can be used to swiftly explore the relationship between these genomic clinic features within and across cancer types and, more importantly, search for corroborating evidence for hypothesis inception.

CellProfiler pipeline for detection of the capillary-to-muscle fiber interface and high-content quantification of fiber type-specific histology.. Because manual immunohistochemical analysis of features such as skeletal muscle fiber typing, capillaries, myonuclei, and fiber size-related parameters is time consuming and prone to user subjectivity, automatic computational methods could allow for faster and more objective evaluation.

Computational prediction of MoRFs based on protein sequences and minimax probability machine.. BACKGROUND:Molecular recognition features (MoRFs) are one important type of disordered segments that can promote specific protein-protein interactions. They are located within longer intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), and undergo disorder-to-order transitions upon binding to their interaction partners. The functional importance of MoRFs and the limitation of experimental identification make it necessary to predict MoRFs accurately with computational methods. RESULTS:In this study, a new sequence-based method, named as MoRFMPM, is proposed for predicting MoRFs. MoRFMPM uses minimax probability machine (MPM) to predict MoRFs based on 16 features and 3 different windows, which neither relying on other predictors nor calculating the properties of the surrounding regions of MoRFs separately.

Modular multi-scale integrated genome graph browser.. Long-read sequencing allows for more sensitive and accurate discovery of SVs, which requires to filter and validate thousands of candidates. However, no existing genome browser meets the demand for cancer genomics. Because most visualization tools show an only range of a linear sequence, making them unsuitable for large (over megabase) or nested SVs. Also, no existing genome browsers allow users to simultaneously inspect the read alignments that span the reference allele and an alternative allele caused by a heterozygous SV. Here we present MoMI-G, a graph genome browser to visualize SVs on the variation graph, that provides a graph-based view that displays a genome with branches and alignments on them. Users can filter, visualize with genomic annotations, and inspect SVs with read alignments.. A genome graph browser for visualization of structural variants (SVs) as a variation graph:
Multi-omics late integration with deep neural networks for drug response prediction | MOTIVATION:Historically, gene expression has been shown to be the most informative data for drug response prediction. Recent evidence suggests that integrating additional omics can improve the prediction accuracy which raises the question of how to integrate the additional omics. Regardless of the integration strategy, clinical utility and translatability are crucial. Thus, we reasoned a multi-omics approach combined with clinical datasets would improve drug response prediction and clinical relevance. RESULTS:We propose MOLI, a multi-omics late integration method based on deep neural networks. MOLI takes somatic mutation, copy number aberration and gene expression data as input, and integrates them for drug response prediction

Enhanced precursor detection and stacked random forests for the sensitive detection of microRNAs.. MicroRNAs are conserved, endogenous small RNAs with critical post-transcriptional regulatory functions throughout eukaryota, including prominent roles in development and disease. Despite much effort, microRNA annotations still contain errors and are incomplete due especially to challenges related to identifying valid miRs that have small numbers of reads, to properly locating hairpin precursors and to balancing precision and recall. Here, we present miRWoods, which solves these challenges using a duplex-focused precursor detection method and stacked random forests with specialized layers to detect mature and precursor microRNAs, and has been tuned to optimize the harmonic mean of precision and recall. We trained and tuned our discovery pipeline on data sets from the well-annotated human genome, and evaluated its performance on data from mouse.

De novo Nanopore read quality improvement using deep learning.. BACKGROUND:Long read sequencing technologies such as Oxford Nanopore can greatly decrease the complexity of de novo genome assembly and large structural variation identification. Currently Nanopore reads have high error rates, and the errors often cluster into low-quality segments within the reads. The limited sensitivity of existing read-based error correction methods can cause large-scale mis-assemblies in the assembled genomes, motivating further innovation in this area. RESULTS:Here we developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based method, called MiniScrub, for identification and subsequent "scrubbing" (removal) of low-quality Nanopore read segments to minimize their interference in downstream assembly process. MiniScrub first generates read-to-read overlaps via MiniMap2, then encodes the overlaps into images, and finally builds CNN models to predict low-quality segments

Framework for the Inference of In Situ Interaction Kinetics from Single-Molecule Imaging Data | Recent experimental and computational developments have been pushing the limits of live-cell single-molecule imaging, enabling the monitoring of intermolecular interactions in their native environment with high spatiotemporal resolution. However, interactions are captured only for the labeled subset of molecules, which tends to be a small fraction. As a result, it has remained a challenge to calculate molecular interaction kinetics, in particular association rates, from live-cell single-molecule tracking data. To overcome this challenge, we developed a mathematical modeling-based Framework for the Inference of in Situ Interaction Kinetics (FISIK) from single-molecule imaging data with substoichiometric labeling

Accurate and fast energy function for computational protein design.. energy potential for protein design.. EvoEF is a composite energy force field that contains two versions. The first version, EvoEF1, includes five energy terms with parameters optimized on two large sets of thermodynamics mutation data (ΔΔGstability and ΔΔGbind), while the second version, EvoEF2, includes nine energy terms and optimized based on recapitulation of protein sequence design. Extensive benchmark and analysis showed that the usefulness of energy functions is highly correlated with the parameter optimization processes. While EvoEF1 performs better than EvoEF2 on ΔΔG estimation, EvoEF2 significantly outperforms EvoEF2 on de novo protein sequence design. Therefore, we suggest users download the two versions according to their own needs.

Novel Sequence Insertion Detection by Constructing an Extended Reference.. Next generation sequencing technology has led to the development of methods for the detection of novel sequence insertions (nsINS). Multiple signatures from short reads are usually extracted to improve nsINS detection performance. However, characterization of nsINSs larger than the mean insert size is still challenging. This paper presents a new method, ERINS, to detect nsINS contents and genotypes of full spectrum range size. It integrates the features of structural variations and mapping states of split reads to find nsINS breakpoints, and then adopts a left-most mapping strategy to infer nsINS content by iteratively extending the standard reference at each breakpoint. Finally, it realigns all reads to the extended reference and infers nsINS genotypes through statistical testing on read counts. We test and validate the performance of ERINS on simulation and real sequencing datasets.

An interactive web tool for microRNA-target enrichment and network-based analysis.. BACKGROUND:miRNAs regulate the expression of several genes with one miRNA able to target multiple genes and with one gene able to be simultaneously targeted by more than one miRNA. Therefore, it has become indispensable to shorten the long list of miRNA-target interactions to put in the spotlight in order to gain insight into understanding the regulatory mechanism orchestrated by miRNAs in various cellular processes. A reasonable solution is certainly to prioritize miRNA-target interactions to maximize the effectiveness of the downstream analysis. RESULTS:We propose a new and easy-to-use web tool MIENTURNET (MicroRNA ENrichment TURned NETwork) that receives in input a list of miRNAs or mRNAs and tackles the problem of prioritizing miRNA-target interactions by performing a statistical analysis followed by a fully featured network-based visualization and analysis

An integrated computational pipeline to infer functional effects of microbiome-host interactions.. Abstract Microbiome-host interactions are important to nearly all living organisms, and play important roles in health and disease. Understanding these inter-kingdom cross-talks has a huge potential to advance diverse scientific domains such as the clinical and medical sciences, agriculture, and ecology. Detecting such interactions by experimental techniques remain challenging from a cost and feasibility perspective thus hampering large-scale analyses. Computational approaches not only make the inference of microbiome-host interactions viable but also scalable. Here, we present MicrobioLink, a computational pipeline to integrate predicted interactions between microbial and host proteins with host molecular networks.

Weighted quality evaluation of assembled microbial genomes | SUMMARY:Metagenomics and single-cell genomics have revolutionized the study of microorganisms, increasing our knowledge of microbial genomic diversity by orders of magnitude. A major issue pertaining to metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) and single-cell amplified genomes (SAGs) is to estimate their completeness and redundancy. Most approaches rely on counting conserved gene markers. In miComplete, we introduce a weighting strategy, where we normalize the presence absence of markers by their median distance to the next marker in a set of complete reference genomes. This approach alleviates biases introduced by the presence absence of shorter DNA pieces containing many markers, e.g. ribosomal protein operons. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION:miComplete is written in Python 3 and released under GPLv3
An extended tool for microarray gene expression analysis.. Gene expression microarrays capture a complete image of all the transcriptional activity in a biological sample. Microarrays produce a large amount of data, which becomes a challenge when it comes to exploring and interpreting using modern computational and statistical tools. We propose the Microarray Analysis (MiCA) tool that outperforms other similar tools both in terms of ease of use and statistical features requiring minimal input to conduct an analysis. MiCA is an integrated, interactive, and streamlined desktop software for the analysis of microarray gene expression data. MiCA consists of a complete microarray analysis pipeline including but not limited to fetching data directly from GEO, normalization, interactive quality control, batch-effect correction, regression analysis, surrogate variable analysis and functional annotation methods such as GSVA using known existing R packages.

Improved target gene prediction.. Abstract Motivation Identifying the genes regulated by a given transcription factor (its “target genes”) is a key step in developing a comprehensive understanding of gene regulation. Previously we developed a method for predicting the target genes of a transcription factor (TF) based solely on the correlation between a histone modification at the TF’s binding site and the expression of the gene across a set of tissues. That approach is limited to organisms for which extensive histone and expression data is available, and does not explicitly incorporate the genomic distance between the TF and the gene. Results We present the T-Gene algorithm, which overcomes these limitations. T-Gene can be used to predict which genes are most likely to be regulated by a TF, and which of the TF’s binding sites are most likely involved in regulating particular genes.

An improved catalogue of putative synaptic genes defined exclusively by temporal transcription profiles through an ensemble machine learning approach.. BACKGROUND:Assembly and function of neuronal synapses require the coordinated expression of a yet undetermined set of genes. Previously, we had trained an ensemble machine learning model to assign a probability of having synaptic function to every protein-coding gene in Drosophila melanogaster. This approach resulted in the publication of a catalogue of 893 genes which we postulated to be very enriched in genes with a still undocumented synaptic function. Since then, the scientific community has experimentally identified 79 new synaptic genes. Here we use these new empirical data to evaluate our original prediction. We also implement a series of changes to the training scheme of our model and using the new data we demonstrate that this improves its predictive power

An Efficient De Novo Peptide Sequencing Tool for Large-scale MS/MS Spectra Analysis | Introduction： As the number of the MS/MS spectra increases rapidly, the excessive computation time taken by MS/MS spectra data analysis has become a critical concern in computational biology. In this work, we designed and implemented SWPepNovo, an efficient de novo peptide sequencing tool for large-scale MS/MS spectra data analysis using a novel peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs) algorithm. To achieve the high performance, we designed an improved scoring algorithm to reduce the time complexity and eliminate the data dependence to enable all possible locality and vectorizations. Performance is also tuned by pre-fetching, double buffering mechanism, and an optimized memory access scheme, to achieve an optimum performance and best utilization of various computing resources within neo-heterogeneous many-core architecture

Spatial Temporal Analysis of Fieldwise Flow in Microvasculature.. Changes in blood flow velocity and distribution are vital in maintaining tissue and organ perfusion in response to varying cellular needs. Further, appearance of defects in microcirculation can be a primary indicator in the development of multiple pathologies. Advances in optical imaging have made intravital microscopy (IVM) a practical approach, permitting imaging at the cellular and subcellular level in live animals at high-speed over time. Yet, despite the importance of maintaining adequate tissue perfusion, spatial and temporal variability in capillary flow is seldom documented. In the standard approach, a small number of capillary segments are chosen for imaging over a limited time. To comprehensively quantify capillary flow in an unbiased way we developed Spatial Temporal Analysis of Fieldwise Flow (STAFF), a macro for FIJI open-source image analysis software

Secondary Structure based End-to-End Learning model for Protein-Ligand Interaction Prediction.. Abstract Computational prediction of bioactivity has become a critical aspect of modern drug discovery as it mitigates the cost, time, and resources required to find and screen new compounds. Deep Neural Networks (DNN) have recently shown excellent performance in modeling Protein-Ligand Interaction (PLI). However, DNNs are only effective when physically sound descriptions of ligands and proteins are fed into the network for further processing. Furthermore, previous research has not incorporated the secondary structure of the protein in a meaningful manner. In this work, we utilize secondary structure information of the protein which is extracted as the curvature and torsion of the backbone of protein to predict PLI.. https://github.com/ekraka/SSnet

A novel ensemble approach for accurate and robust cell-type classification of single-cell transcriptomes | Abstract Background In recent years, the rapid development of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) techniques enables the quantitative characterization of cell types at a single-cell resolution. With the explosive growth of the number of cells profiled in individual scRNA-seq experiments, there is a demand for novel computational methods for classifying newly-generated scRNA-seq data onto annotated labels. Although several methods have recently been proposed for the cell-type classification of single-cell transcriptomic data, such limitations as inadequate accuracy, inferior robustness, and low stability greatly limit their wide applications. Results We propose a novel en semble approach, named EnClaSC, for accurate and robust cell-type cla ssification of s ingle- c ell transcriptomic data

Interpretable machine learning model identifies gene expression biomarkers predicting clinical outcomes and reveals molecular mechanisms of human disease in early stages.. Abstract Gene expression and regulation, a key molecular mechanism driving human disease development, remains elusive, especially at early stages. The increasing amount of genomics data gathered from patients allows for better understanding of gene regulatory mechanisms that occur during disease development at a system level. However, integrating such a large amount of population data is still a challenging task. To address this, we developed an interpretable machine learning model, ECMarker, to predict gene expression biomarkers and regulatory networks specific for disease stages such as early cancer. In particular, ECMarker was built on the semi-restricted Boltzmann machine, a machine learning model with multiple hierarchical layers.

DUETT quantitatively identifies known and novel events in nascent RNA structural dynamics from chemical probing data | MOTIVATION:RNA molecules can undergo complex structural dynamics, especially during transcription, which influence their biological functions. Recently developed high-throughput chemical probing experiments that study RNA cotranscriptional folding generate nucleotide-resolution 'reactivities' for each length of a growing nascent RNA that reflect structural dynamics. However, the manual annotation and qualitative interpretation of reactivity across these large datasets can be nuanced, laborious, and difficult for new practitioners. We developed a quantitative and systematic approach to automatically detect RNA folding events from these datasets to reduce human bias error, standardize event discovery, and generate hypotheses about RNA folding trajectories for further analysis and experimental validation

A Sequence-Based Meta-Predictor for Improving the Prediction of Antiviral Peptides Using Effective Feature Representation.. In spite of the large-scale production and widespread distribution of vaccines and antiviral drugs, viruses remain a prominent human disease. Recently, the discovery of antiviral peptides (AVPs) has become an influential antiviral agent due to their extraordinary advantages. With the avalanche of newly-found peptide sequences in the post-genomic era, there is a great demand to develop a sequence-based predictor for timely identifying AVPs as this information is very useful for both basic research and drug development. In this study, we propose a novel sequence-based meta-predictor with an effective feature representation, called Meta-iAVP, for the accurate prediction of AVPs from given peptide sequences. Herein, the effective feature representation was extracted from a set of prediction scores derived from various machine learning algorithms and types of features

A reference-free, whole genome profiling system to address cytosine/adenine methylation changes.. Methods for investigating DNA methylation nowadays either require a reference genome and high coverage, or investigate only CG methylation. Moreover, no large-scale analysis can be performed for N6-methyladenosine (6 mA) at an affordable price. Here we describe the methylation content sensitive enzyme double-digest restriction-site-associated DNA (ddRAD) technique (MCSeEd), a reduced-representation, reference-free, cost-effective approach for characterizing whole genome methylation patterns across different methylation contexts (e.g., CG, CHG, CHH, 6 mA). MCSeEd can also detect genetic variations among hundreds of samples. MCSeEd is based on parallel restrictions carried out by combinations of methylation insensitive and sensitive endonucleases, followed by next-generation sequencing.

Computational Tool for Mapping Energy Landscapes of Transient Protein-Protein Interactions | MCMap is a tool particularly well-suited for analyzing energy landscapes of transient macromolecular complexes. The program applies a Monte Carlo strategy, where the ligand moves randomly in the electrostatic field of the receptor. By applying importance sampling, the major interaction sites are mapped, resulting in a global distribution of ligand-receptor complexes. This approach displays the dynamic character of transiently interacting protein complexes where not a single complex but an ensemble of complexes better describes the protein interactions. The software provides a broad range of analysis options which allow for relating the simulations to experimental data and for interpreting them on a structural level

MARGO (Massively Automated Real-time GUI for Object-tracking).. Fast object tracking in real time allows convenient tracking of very large numbers of animals and closed-loop experiments that control stimuli for many animals in parallel. We developed MARGO, a MATLAB-based, real-time animal tracking suite for custom behavioral experiments. We demonstrated that MARGO can rapidly and accurately track large numbers of animals in parallel over very long timescales, typically when spatially separated such as in multiwell plates. We incorporated control of peripheral hardware, and implemented a flexible software architecture for defining new experimental routines. These features enable closed-loop delivery of stimuli to many individuals simultaneously. We highlight MARGO's ability to coordinate tracking and hardware control with two custom behavioral assays (measuring phototaxis and optomotor response) and one optogenetic operant conditioning assay.

An environment to design bioimage analysis workflows for large and complex fluorescence microscopy data.. SUMMARY:Open source software such as ImageJ and CellProfiler greatly simplified the quantitative analysis of microscopy images but their applicability is limited by the size, dimensionality and complexity of the images under study. In contrast, software optimized for the needs of specific research projects can overcome these limitations, but they may be harder to find, set up and customize to different needs. Overall, the analysis of large, complex, microscopy images is hence still a critical bottleneck for many Life Scientists. We introduce LOBSTER (Little Objects Segmentation & Tracking Environment), an environment designed to help scientists design and customize image analysis workflows to accurately characterize biological objects from a broad range of fluorescence microscopy images, including large images exceeding workstation main memory.

domain-oriented orthology inference.. BACKGROUND:Orthology inference is normally based on full-length protein sequences. However, most proteins contain independently folding and recurring regions, domains. The domain architecture of a protein is vital for its function, and recombination events mean individual domains can have different evolutionary histories. It has previously been shown that orthologous proteins may differ in domain architecture, creating challenges for orthology inference methods operating on full-length sequences. We have developed Domainoid, a new tool aiming to overcome these challenges faced by full-length orthology methods by inferring orthology on the domain level. It employs the InParanoid algorithm on single domains separately, to infer groups of orthologous domains. RESULTS:This domain-oriented approach allows detection of discordant domain orthologs, cases where different domains on the same protein have different evolutionary histories
A lattice model for simulating phase transitions of multivalent proteins.. Many biomolecular condensates form via spontaneous phase transitions that are driven by multivalent proteins. These molecules are biological instantiations of associative polymers that conform to a so-called stickers-and-spacers architecture. The stickers are protein-protein or protein-RNA interaction motifs and or domains that can form reversible, non-covalent crosslinks with one another. Spacers are interspersed between stickers and their preferential interactions with solvent molecules determine the cooperativity of phase transitions. Here, we report the development of an open source computational engine known as LASSI (LAttice simulation engine for Sticker and Spacer Interactions) that enables the calculation of full phase diagrams for multicomponent systems comprising of coarse-grained representations of multivalent proteins.

A tool for quantification of mRNA and punctate structures in time-lapse images of single cells.. ABSTRACT Many biological processes are regulated by single molecules and molecular assemblies within cells that are visible by microscopy as punctate features, often diffraction limited. Here we present detecting-NEMO (dNEMO), a computational tool optimized for accurate and rapid measurement of fluorescent puncta in fixed-cell and time-lapse images. The spot detection algorithm uses the à trous wavelet transform, a computationally inexpensive method that is robust to imaging noise. By combining automated with manual spot curation in the user interface, fluorescent puncta can be carefully selected and measured against their local background to extract high quality single-cell data. Integrated into the workflow are segmentation and spot-inspection tools that enable almost real-time interaction with images without time consuming pre-processing steps.

DLITE Uses Cell-Cell Interface Movement to Better Infer Cell-Cell Tensions.. Cell shapes and connectivities evolve over time as the colony changes shape or embryos develop. Shapes of intercellular interfaces are closely coupled with the forces resulting from actomyosin interactions, membrane tension, or cell-cell adhesions. Although it is possible to computationally infer cell-cell forces from a mechanical model of collective cell behavior, doing so for temporally evolving forces in a manner robust to digitization difficulties is challenging. Here, we introduce a method for dynamic local intercellular tension estimation (DLITE) that infers such evolution in temporal force with less sensitivity to digitization ambiguities or errors. This method builds upon previous work on single time points (cellular force-inference toolkit). We validate our method using synthetic geometries.

Rapid viral diagnosis from high-throughput sequencing data | High-throughput sequencing (HTS) enables most pathogens in a clinical sample to be detected from a single analysis, thereby providing novel opportunities for diagnosis, surveillance, and epidemiology. However, this powerful technology is difficult to apply in diagnostic laboratories because of its computational and bioinformatic demands. We have developed DisCVR, which detects known human viruses in clinical samples by matching sample k-mers (twenty-two nucleotide sequences) to k-mers from taxonomically labeled viral genomes. DisCVR was validated using published HTS data for eighty-nine clinical samples from adults with upper respiratory tract infections. These samples had been tested for viruses metagenomically and also by real-time polymerase chain reaction assay, which is the standard diagnostic method
A classifier for identifying Y chromosome sequences in male assemblies | BACKGROUND:Although the Y chromosome plays an important role in male sex determination and fertility, it is currently understudied due to its haploid and repetitive nature. Methods to isolate Y-specific contigs from a whole-genome assembly broadly fall into two categories. The first involves retrieving Y-contigs using proportion sharing with a female, but such a strategy is prone to false positives in the absence of a high-quality, complete female reference. A second strategy uses the ratio of depth of coverage from male and female reads to select Y-contigs, but such a method requires high-depth sequencing of a female and cannot utilize existing female references. RESULTS:We develop a k-mer based method called DiscoverY, which combines proportion sharing with female with depth of coverage from male reads to classify contigs as Y-chromosomal

An open-access curated barcode library for diatoms.. Diatoms (Bacillariophyta) are ubiquitous microalgae which produce a siliceous exoskeleton and which make a major contribution to the productivity of oceans and freshwaters. They display a huge diversity, which makes them excellent ecological indicators of aquatic ecosystems. Usually, diatoms are identified using characteristics of their exoskeleton morphology. DNA-barcoding is an alternative to this and the use of High-Throughput-Sequencing enables the rapid analysis of many environmental samples at a lower cost than analyses under microscope. However, to identify environmental sequences correctly, an expertly curated reference library is needed. Several curated libraries for protists exists; none, however are dedicated to diatoms. Diat.barcode is an open-access library dedicated to diatoms which has been maintained since 2012.

> HOMEPAGE MISSING! | A Computational Tool to Classify Single Cell RNA-Seq Data Across Platforms and Across Species | Single-cell RNA-seq has emerged as a powerful tool in diverse applications, from determining the cell-type composition of tissues to uncovering regulators of developmental programs. A near-universal step in the analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data is to hypothesize the identity of each cell. Often, this is achieved by searching for combinations of genes that have previously been implicated as being cell-type specific, an approach that is not quantitative and does not explicitly take advantage of other single-cell RNA-seq studies. Here, we describe our tool, SingleCellNet, which addresses these issues and enables the classification of query single-cell RNA-seq data in comparison to reference single-cell RNA-seq data. SingleCellNet compares favorably to other methods in sensitivity and specificity, and it is able to classify across platforms and species

Process-based species delimitation leads to identification of more biologically relevant species. Most approaches to species delimitation to date have considered divergence-only models. Although these models are appropriate for allopatric speciation, their failure to incorporate many of the population-level processes that drive speciation, such as gene flow (e.g., in sympatric speciation), places an unnecessary limit on our collective understanding of the processes that produce biodiversity. To consider these processes while inferring species boundaries, we introduce the R-package delimitR and apply it to identify species boundaries in the reticulate taildropper slug (Prophysaon andersoni). Results suggest that secondary contact is an important mechanism driving speciation in this system.

DeepSV trains a model from the visualized sequence reads and calls deletions based on this model. We demonstrate that DeepSV outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency of deletion calling on the data from the 1000 Genomes Project. Our work shows that deep learning can potentially lead to effective calling of different types of genetic variations that are complex than SNPs

The protein detection and quantification using high-throughput proteomic technologies is still challenging due to the stochastic nature of the peptide selection in the mass spectrometer, the difficulties in the statistical analysis of the results and the presence of degenerated peptides. However, considering in the analysis only those peptides that could be detected by mass spectrometry (MS), also called proteotypic peptides, increases the accuracy of the results. Several approaches have been applied to predict peptide detectability based on the physicochemical properties of the peptides. In this manuscript we present DeepMSPeptide, a bioinformatic tool that uses a deep learning method to predict proteotypic peptides exclusively based on the peptide amino acid sequences

A novel method for tumor classification via support vector machine with sparse group Lasso.. At present, with the in-depth study of gene expression data, the significant role of tumor classification in clinical medicine has become more apparent. In particular, the sparse characteristics of gene expression data within and between groups. Therefore, this paper focuses on the study of tumor classification based on the sparsity characteristics of genes. On this basis, we propose a new method of tumor classification-Sparse Group Lasso (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) and Support Vector Machine (SGL-SVM). Firstly, the primary selection of feature genes is performed on the normalized tumor datasets using the Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test. Secondly, using a sparse group Lasso for further selection, and finally, the support vector machine serves as a classifier for classification. We validate proposed method on microarray and NGS datasets respectively

Predicting the effects of SNPs on transcription factor binding affinity | MOTIVATION:GWAS have revealed that 88% of disease associated SNPs reside in noncoding regions. However, noncoding SNPs remain understudied, partly because they are challenging to prioritize for experimental validation. To address this deficiency, we developed the SNP effect matrix pipeline (SEMpl). RESULTS:SEMpl estimates transcription factor binding affinity by observing differences in ChIP-seq signal intensity for SNPs within functional transcription factor binding sites genome-wide. By cataloging the effects of every possible mutation within the transcription factor binding site motif, SEMpl can predict the consequences of SNPs to transcription factor binding. This knowledge can be used to identify potential disease-causing regulatory loci

A deep learning predictor for caspase and matrix metalloprotease substrates and cleavage sites | Proteases are enzymes that cleave target substrate proteins by catalyzing the hydrolysis of peptide bonds between specific amino acids. While the functional proteolysis regulated by proteases plays a central role in the 'life and death' process of proteins, many of the corresponding substrates and their cleavage sites were not found yet. Availability of accurate predictors of the substrates and cleavage sites would facilitate understanding of proteases' functions and physiological roles. Deep learning is a promising approach for the development of accurate predictors of substrate cleavage events. RESULTS:We propose DeepCleave, the first deep learning-based predictor of protease-specific substrates and cleavage sites. DeepCleave uses protein substrate sequence data as input and employs convolutional neural networks with transfer learning to train accurate predictive models

A Deep Learning Approach for Virtual Screening of Big Chemical Datasets.. Drug discovery is an extensive and rigorous process that requires up to 2 billion dollars of investments and more than ten years of research and development to bring a molecule “from bench to a bedside”. While virtual screening can significantly enhance drug discovery workflow, it ultimately lags the current rate of expansion of chemical databases that already incorporate billions of purchasable compounds. This surge of available small molecules presents great opportunities for drug discovery but also demands for faster virtual screening methods and protocols. In order to address this challenge, we herein introduce Deep Docking ( D 2 ) - a novel deep learning-based approach which is suited for docking billions of molecular structures.

Identifying clusters of cis-regulatory elements underpinning TAD structures and lineage-specific regulatory networks | Clustering of Genomic Regions Analysis Method | Provides a new method for identification of clusters of genomic regions within chromosomes. Primarily, it is used for calling clusters of cis-regulatory elements (COREs). 'CREAM' uses genome-wide maps of genomic regions in the tissue or cell type of interest, such as those generated from chromatin-based assays including DNaseI, ATAC or ChIP-Seq. 'CREAM' considers proximity of the elements within chromosomes of a given sample to identify COREs in the following steps: 1) It identifies window size or the maximum allowed distance between the elements within each CORE, 2) It identifies number of elements which should be clustered as a CORE, 3) It calls COREs, 4) It filters the COREs with lowest order which does not pass the threshold considered in the approach

A tool to explore and visualize intercellular communication.. Abstract Intercellular communication plays an essential role in multicellular organisms and several algorithms to analyse it from single-cell transcriptional data have been recently published, but the results are often hard to visualize and interpret. We developed COMUNET (Cell cOMmunication exploration with MUltiplex NETworks), a tool that streamlines the interpretation of the results from cell-cell communication analyses. COMUNET uses multiplex networks to represent and cluster all potential communication pathways between cell types. The algorithm also enables the search for specific patterns of communication and can perform comparative analysis between two biological conditions. To exemplify its use, here we apply COMUNET to investigate cell communication patterns in single-cell transcriptomic datasets from mouse embryos and from an acute myeloid leukemia patient at diagnosis and after treatment

Copy Number Variation Detection in Bacterial Circular Genome.. Abstract Motivation Whole genome sequencing (WGS) is widely used for copy number variation (CNV) detection. However, for most bacteria, their circular genome structure and high replication rate make reads more enriched near the replication origin. CNV detection based on read depth could be seriously influenced by such replication bias. Results We show that the replication bias is widespread using ~200 bacterial WGS data. We develop CNV-BAC that can properly normalize the replication bias as well as other known biases in bacterial WGS data and can accurately detect CNVs. Simulation and real data analysis show that CNV-BAC achieves the best performance in CNV detection compared with available algorithms. Availability and implementation CNV-BAC is available at https: github.com LinjieWu CNV-BAC. Contact ruibinxi@math.pku.edu.cn

Large-Scale Profiling of RBP-circRNA Interactions from Public CLIP-Seq Datasets.. Clirc: a user-friendly bioinformatics software to identify RBP-bound circRNAs through analysis of CLIP-Seq data.. The Clirc software is designed to identify RBP-bound circRNAs in CLIP-Seq data. The Clirc software internally calls the gsnap aligner for alignment of CLIP-Seq reads. The CLIP-Seq technology comprises of three variants: HITS-CLIP, PAR-CLIP, and iCLIP. The Clirc software works on all three versions of them. It can also work on any type of RNA-Seq data in general, although non-polyA selected RNA-Seq is preferred. The Clirc software is designed to search for known circRNAs in high-throughput sequencing data whose coordinates are provided by users. The users can collect these coordinates from previous publication or their own search using RNA-Seq data. This avoids the common problem of short sequncing reads in CLIP-Seq data. But this approach cannot identify novel circRNAs in CLIP-Seq data

A Machine Learning Recommendation Method and Webtool for the Prediction of Functional Post-Translational Modifications | ABSTRACT Post-translational Modifications (PTMs), chemical or proteinaceous covalent alterations to the side chains of amino acid residues in proteins, are a rapidly expanding feature class of significant importance in cell biology. Due to a high burden of experimental proof and the lack of effective means for experimentalists to prioritize PTMs by functional significance, currently less than ~2% of all PTMs have an assigned biological function. Here, we describe a new artificial neural network model, SAPH-ire TFx for the functional prediction of experimentally observed eukaryotic PTMs. Unlike previous functional PTM prioritization models, SAPH-ire TFx is optimized with both receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and recall metrics that maximally capture the range of diverse feature sets comprising the functional modified eukaryotic proteome

Defining and targeting adaptations to oncogenic KRASG12C inhibition using quantitative temporal proteomics | ABSTRACT Covalent inhibitors of the KRAS G12C oncoprotein have recently been developed and are being evaluated in clinical trials. Resistance to targeted therapies is common and likely to limit long-term efficacy of KRAS inhibitors (KRASi). To identify pathways of adaptation to KRASi and to predict drug combinations that circumvent resistance, we used a mass spectrometry-based quantitative temporal proteomics and bioinformatics workflow to profile the temporal proteomic response to KRAS G12C inhibition in pancreatic and lung cancer 2D and 3D cellular models. We quantified 10,805 proteins across our datasets, representing the most comprehensive KRASi proteomics effort to date. Our data reveal common mechanisms of acute and long-term response between KRAS G12C -driven tumors

Reproducible PET Pharmacokinetic Modelling in R | ABSTRACT Quantification of Positron Emission Tomography (PET) data is performed using pharmacokinetic models. There exist many models for describing this data, each of which may describe the data better or worse depending on the specific application, and there are both theoretical, practical and empirical reasons to select any one model over another. As such, effective PET modelling requires a high degree of flexibility, while effective communication of all steps taken through scientific publications is not always feasible. Reproducible research practices address these concerns, in that researchers share analysis code, and data if possible, such that all steps are recorded, allowing an independent researcher to reproduce the results and assess their veracity. In this article, I present kinfitr : a software package for performing kinetic modelling using the open-source R language, in a reproducible manner

a Java pipeline for isomiR characterization in miRNA-Seq Data.. MOTIVATION:The existence of complex subpopulations of miRNA isoforms, or isomiRs, is well established. While many tools exist for investigating isomiR populations, they differ in how they characterize an isomiR, making it difficult to compare results across different tools. Thus, there is a need for a more comprehensive and systematic standard for defining isomiRs. Such a standard would allow investigation of isomiR population structure in progressively more refined sub-populations, permitting the identification of more subtle changes between conditions and leading to an improved understanding of the processes that generate these differences. RESULTS:We developed Jasmine, a software tool that incorporates a hierarchal framework for characterizing isomiR populations

An Approach to Identify Individual Functional Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms and Isoform MicroRNAs | MicroRNAs (miRNAs) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) play important roles in disease risk and development, especially cancer. Importantly, when SNPs are located in pre-miRNAs, they affect their splicing mechanism and change the function of miRNAs. To improve disease risk assessment, we propose an approach and developed a software tool, IsomiR_Find, to identify disease phenotype-related SNPs and isomiRs in individuals. Our approach is based on the individual's samples, with SNP information extracted from the 1000 Genomes Project. SNPs were mapped to pre-miRNAs based on whole-genome coordinates and then SNP-pre-miRNA sequences were constructed. Moreover, we developed matpred2, a software tool to identify the four splicing sites of mature miRNAs
Metabolic Modeling of Streptococcus mutans Reveals Complex Nutrient Requirements of an Oral Pathogen.. Streptococcus mutans is a Gram-positive bacterium that thrives under acidic conditions and is a primary cause of tooth decay (dental caries). To better understand the metabolism of S. mutans on a systematic level, we manually constructed a genome-scale metabolic model of the S. mutans type strain UA159. The model, called iSMU, contains 675 reactions involving 429 metabolites and the products of 493 genes. We validated iSMU by comparing simulations with growth experiments in defined medium. The model simulations matched experimental results for 17 of 18 carbon source utilization assays and 47 of 49 nutrient depletion assays. We also simulated the effects of single gene deletions. The model's predictions agreed with 78.1% and 84.4% of the gene essentiality predictions from two experimental data sets.
Hep G2 cell culture confluence measurement in phase-contrast micrographs.. Phase-contrast micrographs are often used for confirmation of proliferation and viability assays. However, they are usually only a qualitative tool and fail to exclude with certainty the presence of assay interference by test substances.

Identifying N7-methylguanosine Sites by Fusing Multiple Features.. N7-methylguanosine (m7G) is an essential RNA modification and participates in a series of biological processes. However, our knowledge about its biological functions is very limited. In order to reveal its new functions, it is necessary to develop various methods to identify m7G sites. Since experimental methods to detect m7G sites are still expensive, we proposed the first computational method, called iRNA-m7G, to detect m7G sites in Homo Sapiens. iRNA-m7G is developed by fusing multiple features, i.e., nucleotide property & frequency, pseudo dinucleotide composition, and secondary structure composition. The framework of iRNA-m7G is shown as following

Identifying protein-DNA binding residues using capsule neural networks.. Since protein-DNA interactions are highly essential to diverse biological events, accurately positioning the location of the DNA-binding residues is necessary. This biological issue, however, is currently a challenging task in the age of post-genomic where data on protein sequences have expanded very fast. In this study, we propose iProDNA-CapsNet -- a new prediction model identifying protein-DNA binding residues using an ensemble of Capsule Neural Networks (CapsNets) on position specific scoring matrix (PSMM) profiles. The use of CapsNets promises an innovative approach to determine the location of DNA-binding residues. In this study, the benchmark datasets introduced by Hu et al. (2017), i.e., PDNA-543 and PDNA-TEST, were used to train and evaluate the model, respectively. To fairly assess the model performance, comparative analysis between iProDNA-CapsNet and existing state-of-the-art methods was done
Single Cell RNA-seq reveals ectopic and aberrant lung resident cell populations in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis | Abstract We provide a single cell atlas of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF), a fatal interstitial lung disease, focusing on resident lung cell populations. By profiling 312,928 cells from 32 IPF, 29 healthy control and 18 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) lungs, we demonstrate that IPF is characterized by changes in discrete subpopulations of cells in the three major parenchymal compartments: the epithelium, endothelium and stroma. Among epithelial cells, we identify a novel population of IPF enriched aberrant basaloid cells that co-express basal epithelial markers, mesenchymal markers, senescence markers, developmental transcription factors and are located at the edge of myofibroblast foci in the IPF lung

Global Peptide-Protein Docking with Structural Templates.. Abstract Motivation Interactions between proteins and peptides or peptide-like intrinsically disordered regions are involved in many important biological processes, such as gene expression and cell life-cycle regulation. Experimentally determining the structure of such interactions is time-consuming, and because of the disordered nature of the ligand, the interactions are especially difficult to predict through software, requiring specialized solutions. Although several prediction-methods exist, most are limited in performance or availability. Results InterPep2 is a freely available method for predicting the structure of peptide-protein interactions. We have previously shown that structural templates can be used to accurately predict peptide-protein binding sites, and that using templates from regular protein-protein interactions will increase the number of sites found
The Case for Sensible Extraction of Interactions in the Era of Machine Learning..

Discovering nuclear targeting signal sequence through protein language learning and multivariate analysis.. Nuclear localization signals (NLSs) are peptides that target proteins to the nucleus by binding to carrier proteins in the cytoplasm that transport their cargo across the nuclear membrane. Accurate identification of NLSs can help elucidate the functions of nuclear protein complexes. The currently known NLS predictors are usually specific to certain species or largely dependent on prior knowledge of NLS basic residues. Thus, a more general predictor is highly desired to reduce the potentially high false positives or false negatives in discovering new NLSs. Here, we report a new method, INSP (Identification Nucleus Signal Peptide), to effectively identify NLS mainly based on statistical knowledge and machine learning algorithms.

Predicting virus-receptor interactions based on similarity and semi-supervised learning.. BACKGROUND:Viral infectious diseases are the serious threat for human health. The receptor-binding is the first step for the viral infection of hosts. To more effectively treat human viral infectious diseases, the hidden virus-receptor interactions must be discovered. However, current computational methods for predicting virus-receptor interactions are limited. RESULT:In this study, we propose a new computational method (IILLS) to predict virus-receptor interactions based on Initial Interaction scores method via the neighbors and the Laplacian regularized Least Square algorithm. IILLS integrates the known virus-receptor interactions and amino acid sequences of receptors. The similarity of viruses is calculated by the Gaussian Interaction Profile (GIP) kernel. On the other hand, we also compute the receptor GIP similarity and the receptor sequence similarity.

Identifying enhancers and their strength using ensembles of convolutional neural networks.. BACKGROUND:Enhancers are non-coding DNA fragments which are crucial in gene regulation (e.g. transcription and translation). Having high locational variation and free scattering in 98% of non-encoding genomes, enhancer identification is, therefore, more complicated than other genetic factors. To address this biological issue, several in silico studies have been done to identify and classify enhancer sequences among a myriad of DNA sequences using computational advances. Although recent studies have come up with improved performance, shortfalls in these learning models still remain. To overcome limitations of existing learning models, we introduce iEnhancer-ECNN, an efficient prediction framework using one-hot encoding and k-mers for data transformation and ensembles of convolutional neural networks for model construction, to identify enhancers and classify their strength.

visually identify sample mix-ups in RNASeq data using a 'genomic' sequence similarity matrix.. A pipeline to detect sample mix-ups in RNASeq data.. Generate a sample similarity matrices from RNASeq data.. Sample confusion is a common laboratory problem. In RNASeq this is frequently tested for by checking whether sex-specific genes (e.g. those located on the Y chromosome or the X inactivation gene) are congruent with the sex listed for that sample in the metadata. However, this method cannot be used to detect sample confusion between patients of the same sex, and is less sensitive when the phenotype skews the sex ratio of samples away from 1:1.. Here we present a tool that leverages RNASeq reads to call genomic SNPs, and use that to generate a similarity matrix between all samples to detect sample confusion.. git clone https://github.com/nicokist/RNASeq_similarity_matrix

A transcriptional toolbox for exploring peripheral neuro-immune interactions.. Abstract Correct communication between immune cells and peripheral neurons is crucial for the protection of our bodies. Its breakdown is observed in many common, often painful conditions, including arthritis, neuropathies and inflammatory bowel or bladder disease. Here, we have characterised the immune response in a mouse model of neuropathic pain using flow cytometry and cell-type specific RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). We found few striking sex differences, but a very persistent inflammatory response, with increased numbers of monocytes and macrophages up to 3½ months after the initial injury. This raises the question of whether the commonly used categorisation of pain into “inflammatory” and “neuropathic” is one that is mechanistically appropriate. Finally, we collated our data with other published RNA-seq datasets on neurons, macrophages and Schwann cells in naïve and nerve injury states

a biological insight into the novel associated genes.. BACKGROUND:Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD) which may significantly impact on the affected individual's life. ADHD is acknowledged to have a high heritability component (70-80%). Recently, a meta-analysis of GWAS (Genome Wide Association Studies) has demonstrated the association of several independent loci. Our main aim here, is to apply PASCAL (pathway scoring algorithm), a new gene-based analysis (GBA) method, to the summary statistics obtained in this meta-analysis. PASCAL will take into account the linkage disequilibrium (LD) across genomic regions in a different way than the most commonly employed GBA methods (MAGMA or VEGAS (Versatile Gene-based Association Study)).

Measuring Intrinsic Disorder and Tracking Conformational Transitions Using Rosetta ResidueDisorder | Many proteins contain regions of intrinsic disorder, not folding into unique, stable conformations. Numerous experimental methods have been developed to measure the disorder of all or select residues. In the absence of experimental data, computational methods are often utilized to identify these disordered regions and thus gain a better understanding of both structure and function. Many freely available computational methods have been developed to predict regions of intrinsic disorder from the primary sequence of a protein, including our recently developed Rosetta ResidueDisorder. While these methods are very useful, they are only designed to predict intrinsic disorder from the sequence
An R package for fine-scale mapping of resistance to dispersal.. Management of biological invasions and conservation activity in the fight against habitat fragmentation both require information on how ongoing dispersal of organisms is affected by the environment. However, there are few landscape genetic programs that map resistance to dispersal at small spatiotemporal scales. To facilitate such analyses, we present an R package named ResDisMapper for the mapping of resistance to dispersal at small spatiotemporal scales, without the need for prior knowledge on environmental features or intensive computation. Based on the concept of isolation by distance (IBD), ResDisMapper calculates resistance using deviations of each pair of samples from the general IBD trend (IBD residuals). The IBD residuals are projected onto the studied area, which allows construction and visualization of a fine-scale map of resistance based on spatial accumulation of positive or negative IBD residuals

a high resolution transposable element insertion site mapping tool for population resequencing.. This tool is for mapping TEs from resequencing data: Stajich lab.. RelocaTE2: a high resolution transposable element insertion sites mapping tool for population resequencing.. RelocaTE2 is an improved version of RelocaTE (Robb et al., 2013). RelocaTE2 is highly sensitive and accurate in mapping transposable elements (TE) polymorphisms at single base pair resolution. RelocaTE2 uses the reads associated with TEs as seeds to cluster the read pairs on chromosomes. It automatically detects the target site duplication (TSD) of a TE insertion from alignments in each cluster, which enable high resolution mapping of TE polymorphisms. Unlike parallel searching of multi-TE elements in RelocaTE, RelocaTE2 searches all TEs in one cycle, which enables us find polymorphisms of thousands of TEs in an individual genome or large population in a reasonable timeframe without losing sensitivity and specificity

Overcoming computational bottlenecks in sequence quality control.. Abstract With the recent torrent of high throughput sequencing (HTS) data the necessity for highly efficient algorithms for common tasks is paramount. One task for which the basis for all further analysis of HTS data is initial data quality control, that is, the removal or trimming of poor quality reads from the dataset. Here we present QuAdTrim, a quality control and adapter trimming algorithm for HTS data that is up to 57 times faster and uses less than 0.06% of the memory of other commonly used HTS quality control programs. QuAdTrim will reduce the time and memory required for quality control of HTS data, and in doing, will reduce the computational demands of a fundamental step in HTS data analysis. Additionally, QuAdTrim impliments the removal of homopolymer Gs from the 3’ end of sequence reads, a common error generated on the NovaSeq, NextSeq and iSeq100 platforms

Many mathematical models have been developed to describe the choice behavior and response time (RT) distributions of observers performing decision-making tasks. However, relatively few researchers use these models because it demands expertise in various numerical, statistical, and software techniques. NEW METHOD:We present a toolbox - Choices and Response Times in R, or ChaRTr - that provides the user the ability to implement and test a wide variety of decision-making models ranging from classic through to modern versions of the diffusion decision model, to models with urgency signals, or collapsing boundaries.

A Multidimensional Systems Biology Analysis of Cellular Senescence in Ageing and Disease | ABSTRACT Cellular senescence, a permanent state of replicative arrest in otherwise proliferating cells, is a hallmark of ageing and has been linked to ageing-related diseases like cancer. Senescent cells have been shown to accumulate in tissues of aged organisms which in turn can lead to chronic inflammation. Many genes have been associated with cell senescence, yet a comprehensive understanding of cell senescence pathways is still lacking. To this end, we created CellAge ( http: genomics.senescence.info cells ), a manually curated database of 279 human genes associated with cellular senescence, and performed various integrative and functional analyses

Poly-Exposure and Poly-Genomic Scores Implicate Prominent Roles of Non-Genetic and Demographic Factors in Four Common Diseases in the UK.. ABSTRACT While polygenic risk scores (PRSs) have been shown to identify a small number of individuals with increased clinical risk for several common diseases, non-genetic factors that change during a lifetime, such as lifestyle, employment, diet, and pollution, have a larger role in clinical prediction. We analyzed data from 459,613 participants of the UK Biobank to investigate the independent and combined roles of demographics (e.g., sex and age), 96 environmental exposures, and common genetic variants in atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and type 2 diabetes. We develop an additive modelling approach to estimate and validate a poly-exposure score (PXS) that goes beyond consideration of a handful of factors such as smoking and pollution

Cross-disease Attention Network for Joint Diabetic Retinopathy and Diabetic Macular Edema Grading.. Diabetic retinopathy (DR) and diabetic macular edema (DME) are the leading causes of permanent blindness in the working-age population. Automatic grading of DR and DME helps ophthalmologists design tailored treatments to patients, thus is of vital importance in the clinical practice. However, prior works either grade DR or DME, and ignore the correlation between DR and its complication, i.e., DME. Moreover, the location information, e.g., macula and soft hard exhaust annotations, are widely used as a prior for grading. Such annotations are costly to obtain, hence it is desirable to develop automatic grading methods with only image-level supervision. In this paper, we present a novel cross-disease attention network (CANet) to jointly grade DR and DME by exploring the internal relationship between the diseases with only image-level supervision

New insights on human essential genes based on integrated analysis and the construction of the HEGIAP web-based platform | Essential genes are those whose loss of function compromises organism viability or results in profound loss of fitness. Recent gene-editing technologies have provided new opportunities to characterize essential genes. Here, we present an integrated analysis that comprehensively and systematically elucidates the genetic and regulatory characteristics of human essential genes. First, we found that essential genes act as 'hubs' in protein-protein interaction networks, chromatin structure and epigenetic modification. Second, essential genes represent conserved biological processes across species, although gene essentiality changes differently among species. Third, essential genes are important for cell development due to their discriminate transcription activity in embryo development and oncogenesis

A R package for genomic selection and its application to a wheat breeding programme | Abstract We developed an integrated R library called BWGS to enable easy computation of Genomic Estimates of Breeding values (GEBV) for genomic selection. BWGS relies on existing R-libraries, all freely available from CRAN servers. The two main functions enable to run 1) replicated random cross validations within a training set of genotyped and phenotyped lines and 2) GEBV prediction, for a set of genotyped-only lines. Options are available for 1) missing data imputation, 2) markers and training set selection and 3) genomic prediction with 15 different methods, either parametric or semi-parametric. The usefulness and efficiency of BWGS are illustrated using a population of wheat lines from a real breeding programme. Adjusted yield data from historical trials (highly unbalanced design) were used for testing the options of BWGS
predictor for cellular protein stability.. Tool for classification of protein variations predictor.. A benchmark database for variations.. Datasets for training and testing cellular protein stability predictor ProTstab:.. Stability of biomolecules, especially of proteins, is of great interest and significance. Protein stability has been the major target for protein engineering, mainly to increase the stability, but sometimes also to destabilize proteins . Effects on stability are among the most common consequences for disease-related variations , thus this phenomenon is of interest for variation interpretation to explain the effects of harmful variants.. We trained a novel machine learning tool for prediction of protein stability, especially melting temperature Tm. The tool is based on amino acid sequence information and using GBRT (Gradient boosting of regression trees) algorithm.

Unblended Disjoint Tree Merging using GTM improves species tree estimation.. Abstract Phylogeny estimation is an important part of much biological research, but large-scale tree estimation is infeasible using standard methods due to computational issues. Recently, an approach to large-scale phylogeny has been proposed that divides a set of species into disjoint subsets, computes trees on the subsets, and then merges the trees together using a computed matrix of pairwise distances between the species. The novel component of these approaches is the last step: Disjoint Tree Merger (DTM) methods. We present GTM (Guide Tree Merger), a polynomial time DTM method that adds edges to connect the subset trees, so as to provably minimize the topological distance to a computed guide tree. Thus, GTM performs unblended mergers, unlike the previous DTM methods

Perturbation-based gene regulatory network inference to unravel oncogenic mechanisms | Abstract The gene regulatory network (GRN) of human cells encodes mechanisms to ensure proper functioning. However, if this GRN is dysregulated, the cell may enter into a disease state such as cancer. Understanding the GRN as a system can therefore help identify novel mechanisms underlying disease, which can lead to new therapies. Reliable inference of GRNs is however still a major challenge in systems biology. To deduce regulatory interactions relevant to cancer, we applied a recent computational inference framework to data from perturbation experiments in squamous carcinoma cell line A431. GRNs were inferred using several methods, and the false discovery rate was controlled by the NestBoot framework. We developed a novel approach to assess the predictiveness of inferred GRNs against validation data, despite the lack of a gold standard

> HOMEPAGE BROKEN! | Predicting functional targets of RNA binding proteins based on CLIP-seq peaks | RNA-protein interaction plays important roles in post-transcriptional regulation. Recent advancements in cross-linking and immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (CLIP-seq) technologies make it possible to detect the binding peaks of a given RNA binding protein (RBP) at transcriptome scale. However, it is still challenging to predict the functional consequences of RBP binding peaks. In this study, we propose the Protein-RNA Association Strength (PRAS), which integrates the intensities and positions of the binding peaks of RBPs for functional mRNA targets prediction. We illustrate the superiority of PRAS over existing approaches on predicting the functional targets of two related but divergent CELF (CUGBP, ELAV-like factor) RBPs in mouse brain and muscle

A Low-Cost, Open-Access Automated Gait Analysis System for Assessing Motor Deficits | Gait analysis is used to quantify changes in motor function in many rodent models of disease. Despite the importance of assessing gait and motor function in many areas of research, the available commercial options have several limitations such as high cost and lack of accessible, open code. To address these issues, we developed PrAnCER, Paw-Print Analysis of Contrast-Enhanced Recordings, for automated quantification of gait. The contrast-enhanced recordings are produced by using a translucent floor that obscures objects not in contact with the surface, effectively isolating the rat's paw prints as it walks. Using these videos, our simple software program reliably measures a variety of spatiotemporal gait parameters. To demonstrate that PrAnCER can accurately detect changes in motor function, we employed a haloperidol model of Parkinson's disease (PD)

personalized PageRank and semantic similarity measures for entity linking.. BACKGROUND:Biomedical literature concerns a wide range of concepts, requiring controlled vocabularies to maintain a consistent terminology across different research groups. However, as new concepts are introduced, biomedical literature is prone to ambiguity, specifically in fields that are advancing more rapidly, for example, drug design and development. Entity linking is a text mining task that aims at linking entities mentioned in the literature to concepts in a knowledge base. For example, entity linking can help finding all documents that mention the same concept and improve relation extraction methods. Existing approaches focus on the local similarity of each entity and the global coherence of all entities in a document, but do not take into account the semantics of the domain. RESULTS:We propose a method, PPR-SSM, to link entities found in documents to concepts from domain-specific ontologies

transforming GO terms and proteins to vector representations via graph embeddings.. BACKGROUND:Semantic similarity between Gene Ontology (GO) terms is a fundamental measure for many bioinformatics applications, such as determining functional similarity between genes or proteins. Most previous research exploited information content to estimate the semantic similarity between GO terms; recently some research exploited word embeddings to learn vector representations for GO terms from a large-scale corpus. In this paper, we proposed a novel method, named GO2Vec, that exploits graph embeddings to learn vector representations for GO terms from GO graph. GO2Vec combines the information from both GO graph and GO annotations, and its learned vectors can be applied to a variety of bioinformatics applications, such as calculating functional similarity between proteins and predicting protein-protein interactions

Predicting human lncRNA-disease associations based on geometric matrix completion.. Recently, increasing evidences have indicated that dysregulations of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are implicated in various complex diseases. However, only a limited number of lncRNA-disease associations are experimentally verified. Prioritizing potential lncRNA-disease associations is beneficial not only for understanding disease mechanisms at lncRNA level, but also for disease diagnosis. Various computational methods have been proposed, but precise prediction and full use of data's intrinsic structure are still challenging. In this study, we propose a new method, named GMCLDA (Geometric Matrix Completion lncRNA-Disease Association), to infer potential lncRNA-disease associations based on geometric matrix completion.

Assembling Exon Using Gene Capture Data | Exon capture across species has been one of the most broadly applied approaches to acquire multi-locus data in phylogenomic studies of non-model organisms. Methods for assembling loci from short-read sequences (eg, Illumina platforms) that rely on mapping reads to a reference genome may not be suitable for studies comprising species across a wide phylogenetic spectrum; thus, de novo assembling methods are more generally applied. Current approaches for assembling targeted exons from short reads are not particularly optimized as they cannot (1) assemble loci with low read depth, (2) handle large files efficiently, and (3) reliably address issues with paralogs. Thus, we present Assexon: a streamlined pipeline that de novo assembles targeted exons and their flanking sequences from raw reads

An integrative machine learning approach to discovering multi-level molecular mechanisms of obesity using data from monozygotic twin pairs.. We combined clinical, cytokine, genomic, methylation and dietary data from 43 young adult monozygotic twin pairs (aged 22 36, 53% female), where 25 of the twin pairs were substantially weight discordant (delta BMI > 3kg m2). These measurements were originally taken as part of the TwinFat study, a substudy of The Finnish Twin Cohort study. These five large multivariate data sets (comprising 42, 71, 1587, 1605 and 63 variables, respectively) were jointly analysed using an integrative machine learning method called Group Factor Analysis (GFA) to offer new hypotheses into the multi-molecular-level interactions associated with the development of obesity. New potential links between cytokines and weight gain are identified, as well as associations between dietary, inflammatory and epigenetic factors

A web application and database for gene family-based classification and functional enrichment analysis.. Genome-scale studies using high-throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies generate substantial lists of differentially expressed genes under different experimental conditions. These gene lists need to be further mined to narrow down biologically relevant genes and associated functions in order to guide downstream functional genetic analyses. A popular approach is to determine statistically overrepresented genes in a user-defined list through enrichment analysis tools, which rely on functional annotations of genes based on Gene Ontology (GO) terms. Here, we propose a new computational approach, GenFam, which allows annotation, classification, and enrichment of genes based on their gene family, thus simplifying identification of candidate gene families and associated genes that may be relevant to the query.

an integrated database and analytic platform for de novo mutations in humans.. De novo mutations (DNMs) significantly contribute to sporadic diseases, particularly in neuropsychiatric disorders. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) provide effective methods for detecting DNMs and prioritizing candidate genes. However, it remains a challenge for scientists, clinicians, and biologists to conveniently access and analyse data regarding DNMs and candidate genes from scattered publications. To fill the unmet need, we integrated 580 799 DNMs, including 30 060 coding DNMs detected by WES WGS from 23 951 individuals across 24 phenotypes and prioritized a list of candidate genes with different degrees of statistical evidence, including 346 genes with false discovery rates <0.05. We then developed a database called Gene4Denovo (http: www.genemed.tech gene4denovo ), which allowed these genetic data to be conveniently catalogued, searched, browsed, and analysed
Bayesian differential splicing accounting for sample-to-sample variability and mapping uncertainty | BANDITS: Bayesian ANalysis of DIfferenTial Splicing | BANDITS is a Bayesian hierarchical model for detecting differential splicing of genes and transcripts, via differential transcript usage (DTU), between two or more conditions. The method uses a Bayesian hierarchical framework, which allows for sample specific proportions in a Dirichlet-Multinomial model, and samples the allocation of fragments to the transcripts. Parameters are inferred via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques and a DTU test is performed via a multivariate Wald test on the posterior densities for the average relative abundance of transcripts
A Novel Bayesian Network Structural Learning Algorithm and Its Comprehensive Performance Evaluation Against Open-Source Software | Structural learning of Bayesian networks (BNs) from observational data has gained increasing applied use and attention from various scientific and industrial areas.

an R package for integrating, analyzing and visualizing bacterial microscopy data | Abstract High-throughput analyses of single-cell microscopy data is a critical tool within the field of bacterial cell biology. Several programs have been developed to specifically segment bacterial cells from phase-contrast images. Together with spot and object detection algorithms, these programs offer powerful approaches to quantify observations from microscopy data, ranging from cell-to-cell genealogy to localization and movement of proteins. Most segmentation programs contain specific post-processing and plotting options, but these options vary between programs and possibilities to optimize or alter the outputs are often limited. Therefore, we developed BactMAP ( Bac terial t oolbox for M icroscopy A nalysis & P lotting), a software package that allows researchers to transform cell segmentation and spot detection data generated by different programs automatically into various plots

a simple and fast global epistatic model predicting mutational effects | The systematic and accurate description of protein mutational landscapes is a question of utmost importance in biology, bioengineering and medicine. Recent progress has been achieved by leveraging on the increasing wealth of genomic data and by modelling inter-site dependencies within biological sequences. However, state-of-the-art methods remain time consuming. Here, we present GEMME (www.lcqb.upmc.fr GEMME), an original and fast method that predicts mutational outcomes by explicitly modelling the evolutionary history of natural sequences. This allows accounting for all positions in a sequence when estimating the effect of a given mutation. GEMME uses only a few biologically meaningful and interpretable parameters. Assessed against 50 high- and low-throughput mutational experiments, it overall performs similarly or better than existing methods

Automated annotation of amino acid biosynthesis | Abstract GapMind is a web-based tool for annotating amino acid biosynthesis in bacteria and archaea ( http: papers.genomics.lbl gov gaps ). GapMind incorporates many variant pathways and 130 different reactions, and it analyzes a genome in just 15 seconds. To avoid error-prone “transitive” annotations, GapMind relies primarily on a database of experimentally-characterized proteins. GapMind correctly handles fusion proteins and split proteins, which often cause errors for “best hit” approaches. To improve GapMind’s coverage, we examined genetic data from 35 bacteria that grow in minimal media and we filled many gaps in amino acid biosynthesis pathways.

Accurate estimation of microbial sequence diversity with Distanced | Distanced is a bioinformatics tool that estimates diversity of microbes. Specifically, it estimates the diversity of ribosomal DNA sequences within microbial communities. Estimating diversity of microbes is a challenge because errors in sequence create false sequences and inflate diversity. Distanced overcomes this problem by correcting values of mean pairwise distance, a measure of within-sample diversity, for the expected increase after sequencing | Distanced requires a set a DNA sequence reads in fastq format. A set of reference sequences in fasta format is optional. If reference sequences are provided, Distanced will report the actual diversity of the DNA sequences, providing a check on accuracy
An automatic classification tool for PVS1 interpretation of null variants | Abstract Null variants are prevalent within human genome, and their accurate interpretation is critical for clinical management. In 2018, the ClinGen Sequence Variant Interpretation (SVI) Working Group refined the only criterion (PVS1) for pathogenicity in the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology (ACMG AMP) guidelines. The refinement may improve interpretation consistency, but it also brings hurdles to biocurators because of the complicated workflows and multiple bioinformatics sources required. To address these issues, we developed an automatic classification tool called AutoPVS1 to streamline PVS1 interpretation. We assessed the performance of AutoPVS1 using 56 variants manually curated by ClinGen’s SVI Working Group and achieved an interpretation concordance of 95% (53 56)
Improvements on AutoDock Affinity Maps and Associated Software Tools | Precomputed affinity maps are used by AutoDock to efficiently describe rigid biomolecules called receptors in automated docking.

Design a prototype for automated patient diagnosis in wireless sensor networks | It is indeed necessary to design of an elderly support mobile healthcare and monitoring system on wireless sensor network (WSN) for dynamic monitoring. It comes from the need for maintenance of healthcare among patients and elderly people that leads to the demand on change in traditional monitoring approaches among chronic disease patients and alert on acute events. In this paper, we propose a new automated patient diagnosis called automated patient diagnosis (AUPA) using ATmega microcontrollers over environmental sensors. AUPA monitors and aggregates data from patients through network connected over web server and mobile network. The scheme supports variable data management and route establishment. Data transfer is established using adaptive route discovery and management approaches
Cell type prioritization in single-cell data.. Augur is an R package to prioritize cell types involved in the response to an experimental perturbation within high-dimensional single-cell data. The intuition underlying Augur is that cells undergoing a profound response to a given experimental stimulus become more separable, in the space of molecular measurements, than cells that remain unaffected by the stimulus. Augur quantifies this separability by asking how readily the experimental sample labels associated with each cell (e.g., treatment vs. control) can be predicted from molecular measurements alone. This is achieved by training a machine-learning model specific to each cell type, to predict the experimental condition from which each individual cell originated. The accuracy of each cell type-specific classifier is evaluated in cross-validation, providing a quantitative basis for cell type prioritization

A new method for studying the spatial distribution of mRNA in astrocytes | Abstract Cells with a complex shape often use mRNA distribution and local translation to regulate distal functions. These mechanisms have recently been described in astrocytes, the processes of which contact and functionally modulate neighbouring synapses and blood vessels. In order to study the distribution of mRNA in astrocytes, we developed a three-dimensional histological method that combines mRNA detection via in situ hybridization with immunostaining of the astrocyte-specific intermediate filament glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Three-dimensional confocal images were analyzed using AstroDot, a custom Image J plug-in developed in-house for the identification and quantification of mRNAs in GFAP-immunolabelled astrocyte somata, large processes and fine processes
Combining evolutionary conservation and proteomics to assess prokaryotic gene predictions | MOTIVATION:A core task of genomics is to identify the boundaries of protein coding genes, which may cover over 90% of a prokaryote's genome. Several programs are available for gene finding, yet it is currently unclear how well these programs perform and whether any offers superior accuracy. This is in part because there is no universal benchmark for gene finding and, therefore, most developers select their own benchmarking strategy. RESULTS:Here, we introduce AssessORF, a new approach for benchmarking prokaryotic gene predictions based on evidence from proteomics data and the evolutionary conservation of start and stop codons. We applied AssessORF to compare gene predictions offered by GenBank, GeneMarkS-2, Glimmer, and Prodigal on genomes spanning the prokaryotic tree of life
A Program for Assembling Splice Junctions Analysis | RNA splicing may generate different kinds of splice junctions, such as linear, back-splice and fusion junctions.

a web server for allele-specific sgRNA design in precision medicine | Abstract Allele-specific targeting by CRISPR provides a point of entry for personalized gene therapy of dominantly inherited diseases, by selectively disrupting the mutant alleles or disease-causing single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), ideally while leaving normal alleles intact. Despite unprecedented specificity and tremendous therapeutic utility of allele-specific targeting by CRISPR, few bioinformatic tools have been implemented for the allele-specific purpose. We thus developed AsCRISPR ( A llele- s pecific CRISPR ), a web tool to aid the design of guide sequences that can discriminate between alleles. It can process with query sequences harboring single-base or short insertion-deletion (indel) mutations, as well as heterozygous SNPs deposited in the dbSNP database. Multiple CRISPR nucleases and their engineered variants including newly-developed Cas12b and CasX are included for users’ choice
Development and validation of a predictive model for American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status.. BACKGROUND:The American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status (ASA-PS) classification system was developed to categorize the fitness of patients before surgery. Increasingly, the ASA-PS has been applied to other uses including justification of inpatient admission. Our objectives were to develop and cross-validate a statistical model for predicting ASA-PS; and 2) assess the concurrent and predictive validity of the model by assessing associations between model-derived ASA-PS, observed ASA-PS, and a diverse set of 30-day outcomes. METHODS:Using the 2014 American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) Participant Use Data File, we developed and internally cross-validated multinomial regression models to predict ASA-PS using preoperative NSQIP data. Accuracy was assessed with C-Statistics and calibration plots
Computational validation of fusion gene detection tools without relying on simulated reads | MOTIVATION:Gene fusions are an important class of transcriptional variants that can influence cancer development and can be predicted from RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data by multiple existing tools. However, real world performance of these tools is unclear due to the lack of known positive and negative events, especially with regard to fusion genes in individual samples. Often simulated reads are used, but these cannot account for all technical biases in RNA-seq data generated from real samples. RESULTS:Here we present ArtiFuse, a novel approach that simulates fusion genes by sequence modification to the genomic reference, and therefore can be applied to any RNA-seq dataset without the need for any simulated reads
An automation system for a sequencing core facility.. StackStorm packs to automate sequencing center operations.. Event-driven sequencing center automation..

an R Package to annotate and prioritize putative oncogenic RNA fusions.. Filter and prioritize fusion calls.. Using annoFuse, users can filter out fusions known to be artifactual and retained high-quality fusion calls using support of at least one junction read and remove false calls if there is disproportionate spanning fragment support of more than 10 reads compared to the junction read count. For prioritization, users can capture known as well as putative driver fusions reported in TCGA, or fusions containing gene partners that are known oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, or COSMIC genes. Finally, users can also determine recurrent fusions across the cohort and recurrently-fused genes within each histology. By providing a standardized filtering and annotation method from multiple callers (STAR-Fusion and Arriba) users are able to merge, filter and prioritize putative oncogenic fusions across the PBTA
Automated methylation analysis of amplicons from bisulfite flowgram sequencing.. The Roche 454 GS Junior sequencing platform allows locus-specific DNA methylation analysis using deep bisulfite amplicon sequencing. However, bisulfite-converted DNA reads may contain long T homopolymers, and the main sources of errors on pyrosequencing platforms are homopolymer over- and undercalls. Furthermore, existing tools do not always meet the analysis requirements for complex assay designs with multiple regions of interest (ROIs) from multiple samples.

Revisiting the "satisfaction of spatial restraints" approach of MODELLER for protein homology modeling.. altMOD is a MODELLER (https://salilab.org/modeller/) [1] plugin for improved 3D homology model building. Right now, it allows to incorporate in the program's objective function terms for interatomic distances statistical potentials, such as DOPE [2] and DFIRE [3]. The effect of adding statistical potentials in the objective function of MODELLER is described in Revisiting the "satisfaction of spatial restraints" approach of MODELLER for protein homology modeling" (Janson et al., 2019). In a benchmark with 225 single-template homology models, we found that the inclusion of DOPE in the objective function of MODELLER brings an average improvement of 1.3% and 2.0% in GDT-HA [4] and lDDT [5] and a large improvement of -29.8% in MolProbity scores [6]
PURPOSE:The automated segmentation of each lung and trachea in CT scans is commonly taken as a solved problem. Indeed, existing approaches may easily fail in the presence of some abnormalities caused by a disease, trauma, or previous surgery. For robustness, we present ALTIS (implementation is available at http: lids.ic.unicamp.br downloads) - a fast automatic lung and trachea CT-image segmentation method that relies on image features and relative shape- and intensity-based characteristics less affected by most appearance variations of abnormal lungs and trachea. METHODS:ALTIS consists of a sequence of image foresting transforms (IFTs) organized in three main steps: (a) lung-and-trachea extraction, (b) seed estimation inside background, trachea, left lung, and right lung, and (c) their delineation such that each object is defined by an optimum-path forest rooted at its internal seeds

mapping distal regulatory elements using convolutional learning on GPU.. BACKGROUND:The data deluge can leverage sophisticated ML techniques for functionally annotating the regulatory non-coding genome. The challenge lies in selecting the appropriate classifier for the specific functional annotation problem, within the bounds of the hardware constraints and the model's complexity. In our system AIKYATAN, we annotate distal epigenomic regulatory sites, e.g., enhancers. Specifically, we develop a binary classifier that classifies genome sequences as distal regulatory regions or not, given their histone modifications' combinatorial signatures. This problem is challenging because the regulatory regions are distal to the genes, with diverse signatures across classes (e.g., enhancers and insulators) and even within each class (e.g., different enhancer sub-classes)

Towards gene regulatory network predictions of high-certainty | Abstract Motivation Reverse engineering of gene regulatory networks has for years struggled with high correlation in expression between regulatory elements. If two regulators have matching expression patterns it is impossible to differentiate between the two, and thus false positive identifications are abundant. Results To allow for gene regulation predictions of high confidence, we propose a novel method, LiPLike, that assumes a regression model and iteratively searches for interactions that cannot be replaced by a linear combination of other predictors. To compare the performance of LiPLike with other available inference methods, we benchmarked LiPLike using three independent datasets from the previous DREAM5 challenge

Anncolvar builds a feed-forward neural network for approximation of a collective variable of a molecular system. Molecular simulations are slow due to fact that a studied system tends to stay in local energy minima. Methods such as metadynamics address this problem by application of artificial forces acting on collective variables. Collective variables are some descriptors of the state of the molecular system. For example, when simulation binding of a ligand to protein it is possible to use their distance as a collective variable and by applying force onto this collective variable you can accelerate binding and unbinding. However, some sophisticated collective variables are difficult to calculate. For this purpose we developed Anncolvar to approximate such collective variables using artificial neural network.

A program for manipulating Affymetrix SNP metadata. SNPsetter will filter the SNPs exported, by chromosome, by allele frequency, or by distance from the last-exported SNP.
An application that uses the Self-Organizing Map neural network algorithm for codon usage anaysis and gene-prediction. In its gene prediction functionality, RescueNet can estimate multiple models of gene codon usage properties during training. This offers advantageous gene-finding performance in cases where a diverse number of codon usage patterns are displayed.
Graphs are abstract representations of relationships between entities. Through a set of instructions, they are able to convert relationships into nodes and edges. This tool (originally: The RNA sorting hat) leverages the information available from graph properties and the predictive power of support vector machines (SVMs) to classify potential RNA sequences as functional/non-functional and into 1 of 46 Rfam families. In short, GraPPLE predicts the potential function of an ncRNA sequence.
Freely-available, biologist-friendly, stand-alone application for exploring the temporal dynamics and genetic control of transcription in the human prefrontal cortex across the lifespan. The BrainCloud applications will contain expression or methylation data, while users will have to register with dbGaP to integrate SNP data.
AmbiguityRemover removes ambiguously aligned sites from protein sequence alignments, for input into AsymmetryCounter. AsymmetryCounter counts the number of amino acid substitutions in each direction between pairs of protein sequences. . AsymmetryScaler takes the results from AsymmetryCounter and summarizes substitutional asymmetry data in a single scale.
BAGEL2 (BActeriocin GEnome mining tooL) identifies putative bacteriocins on the basis of conserved domains, physical properties and genomic context. Improved genome mining capacity from BAGEL.
SeqSite is an efficient and easy-to-use software tool implementing a novel method for identifying and pinpointing transcription factor binding sites. It first detects transcription factor binding regions by clustering tags and statistical hypothesis testing, and locates every binding site in detected binding regions by modeling the tag profiles. It can pinpoint closely spaced adjacent binding sites from ChIP-seq data. This software is coded in C/C++, and supports major computer platforms.
CancerResource, a database that integrates cancer-relevant relationships of compounds and targets from (i) literature mining and (ii) external resources complemented with (iii) essential experimental and supporting information on genes and cellular effects. CancerResource addresses the spectrum of research on compound-target interactions in natural sciences as well as in individualized medicine.
ODIN is an HMM-based approach to detect and analyse differential peaks in pairs of ChIP-seq data.
